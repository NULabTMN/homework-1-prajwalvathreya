          Another cw Klement. Three French chemists M. and Mine, Curie and M. Bemont have discovered a new metallic element, 
          which they call "radium," because of its remarkable property of emitting rays which resemble in their penetrative power Prof. Roentgen's celebrated X rays. 
          Not long ago much surprise was caused by the discovery that uranium is capable of emitting similar rays, 
          but the power of radium in this respect is said to be 900 times greater than that of uranium.

          Pennsylvania exhibited lut week for
          the first time In America the newly
          discovered chemical element radium
          which seems destined to create a groat
          stir In the scientific world Yearn ago
          Bequercl found that Halts of the ruie
          metal uranium posesirod the power of
          throwing off a feeble and Invisible ra

          elements that hehavc In tho Mime man
          ner but are far more active One of
          them she called polonium anil tho
          other milium The latter Is said to
          be 100000 times as Intense as uranium
          In Its photographic effect
          Trof Binkcr has been experimenting
          with nil three of these elements and
          with the mineral pltchblend or lira
          nlte from which the tVB now ele
          ments nro derived He showed to the
          Bibliographical Club here this week a
          heiies of photographic plates on which
          Impressions had been produced by
          these substances Ills pioccdure has
          been as follows
          A photographic plate was Inclosed
          in black paper and then coveted with
          yellow paper After one whole days
          exposure to tho sunlight no effect was
          produced This piecnutlon proved the
          thoroughness of the protection Then
          the various metals and salts were
          placed upon tho paper covered plate
          and they produced dark stains
          In order to take photographs of ob
          jects such as n hand or foot these ob
          jects would he placed between tho met
          nl and the plate and the result would
          be similar to those obtained by the
          X rays such substances as bone would
          show dearly through the tlosh and sur
          rounding tlt suc A photograph can be
          taken by means of radium In half a
          minute
          The Importance of this discovery
          can hardly be overestimated The won
          derful results of the X rays now so
          usoful In surgical diagnosis au be du
          plicated by a method much cheaper
          Moreover radium seems to suffer no
          diminution of energy or loss of weight
          during tho process In nddltlon to pro
          ducing nn Impression on th6 photo
          graphic plate radium produces phos
          phorescence and discharges electrified
          bodies Thus It will be seen thnt it
          possesses nil tho qualities of tho Ro
          entgen rays
          Itndlum apparently violates ono of
          the fundamental laws of physics
          namely that of tho conservation of en
          ergy It does not derive Its photograph
          ic power from the sunlight nor loso It
          by expenditurenservation of energy principle and offers revolutionary applications in imaging and diagnosis.

          The First Woman Professor In the
          Famous Sorbonne University at
          Paris —Mme. Curie as She Ap
          pears When Lecturing
          A slender, youthfnl woman in deep
          mourning, ber fair hair swept plainly
          back from a remarkably broad, high.
          full brow, her head seemingly almost
          too large for the slim neck that car
          ried it. her manner so simple, so un
          conscious and sincere that it was child
          like—such was the appearance of Mmc
          Curie as she stood in a class room de
          livering the first lecture ever given by
          a woman professor to the students of
          the University of Paris. It was an
          event which should make women all
          over the world rejoice and take cour
          age, because at last the earnest, de
          voted scientific work of one of their
          MME. CLXIX LECTURING.
          sex has been fittingly recognized.
          Mme. Marie Sklodowska Curie, discov
          erer of radium. Is by birth it Pole. Her
          father was a professor of sciences in
          the town where Marie spent her child
          hood, and she was interested in re
          torts, test tubes and chemicals at an
          age when girl children are expected to
          play with dolls. But little Marie never
          did play with dolls. She used to spend
          her time In tbe professor's laboratory
          and frequently amazed with her wis
          dom and knowledge grave, learued
          meu who called on her father. After
          finishing the scientific course in the
          school of her borne town of Varsovie
          the young girl went to Paris to study
          further. There she met Pierre Curie,
          student of chemistry, as enthusiastic as
          herself. They were at once drawn to
          each other and in time were married.

          WOMAN WINS NOBEL
          CHEMISTRY AWARD
          Mme. Curte, Discoverer o! Ra
          dium and Polonium, Given
          $40,000 Prize
          STOCKHOLM. Nov. 7.—The Nobel
          prize for chemistry has been awarded
          to Mme. Marie Sklodowska Curie of the
          University of Paris.
          Mme. Curie is the chief professor of
          sciences in the University of Paris. She
          was the discoverer, with her husband.
          Prof. Pierre Curie, of radium, and in
          1903 shared with him half of the Xobel
          pflze for physics, the other half being
          awarded to Prof. Antoine Henri Bec
          queret. Each of the five Nobel prizes
          awarded annually amounts to $40,000.
          Recent announcement was made of
          the success of Mme. Curie in producing
          polonium, "a new element possessing a
          radio activity superior to radium.

          Madame Marie Curie, discoverer
          0t radium and 46blest woman in
          the world, will visit this country
          in 14y. That interests you, and
          MW PROVE your interest.
          WOmen of America have un
          dertakes to raise a Madame Curie
          had of $100,000. The money is
          set for Madame Curie. Money
          does not Interest her now, any
          more than when she lived in Paris
          as young girl, washing bottles in
          a laboratory that she might con
          tinue her scientific studies on an
          Incom, of twenty dollars a month
          And a diet of black bread and milk.
          The $100,000 Madame Curie
          Fund will be used to purchase one
          grain of radium for the woman
          that discovered radium. And that
          radium will be used by Madame
          Curie in her scientific |studies
          the studies that have given such
          magnificent results to the world
          Of science and have never given
          one sany of profit to Madame
          Curie.
          Radium is the one hope of un
          happy thousands that suffer from
          eancer. Radium is destined to
          open many closed doors of science.
          Radium will furnish the key to
          Material equilibrium in the uni
          verse. What is the world's debt to
          the woman that discovered radium
          dad gave her discovery to the
          world FREE?
          As you answer that question, re
          peat the useful formula supplied
          by Yames, 1:22:
          "Dst be ye doers o
          ad %o hearers only.'
          This writer sends one hundred
          dollars to the "Marie Curie Ra
          dium Fund," in care of Equitable
          Trust Company, New York city.
          The modest contribution' is sent in
          memory of Julia Ward Howe. Be
          Ing sent in memory of an Amer
          Can woman, it will, perhaps, be ac
          cepted by an American woman's
          fand. Julia Ward Howe, when she
          wrote the "Battle Hymn of the Re
          public," produced a spiritual ra
          dium that penetrated many cold
          hearts and many dull minds.
          There should be a thousand men
          ft the United States eager to send
          each one hundred dollars to such
          a fund, and to each will occur the
          name of some good American
          woman in whose honor the money
          could be sent and thus made ac
          ceptable. There follow some facts
          about Madame Curie.
          Dr. Ladislas Sklodowski, profes
          r of hysics at Warsaw, m"rried
          Vat Ua Boguska, principal of
          O Is' school.
          November 7., -1867o r
          daughter was born. She grew up
          in her fathe's laboratory, looking
          after his toA tubs,.gorucibles, and
          Uithr-ap ats from the time she
          was gix years old.
          At sixteen Marie Sklodowski,
          now Marie Curie, was graduated
          from the -Girls' Gymnasium, re
          esiving a medal of gold. She was
          then a well-educated scientist.
          Next she worked in the physics
          Iaboratory of the Industrial Mu
          mum. in Warsaw.
          On her father's death rhe went
          to Paris to continue her scientific
          studies. On an income of $20 a
          aonth she lived alone in one small
          room, her furniture an iron bed
          and one chair, her diet black bread
          and milk.
          She found work in a scientific
          laborator as a washer of bottles
          and contmiued her studies. Pro
          fessor Lip n, observing her
          ability, ealed her to obtain a
          free course in physics, chemistry,
          and mathnenatics at the Sorbonne,
          *where she now lectures and teaches,
          the first woman tq be thus hon
          ered.
          You have heard "proud man"
          guestion woman's mental power.
          It would do such men good to fol
          low Madame Curie's work as it led
          up to her discovery of radium, a
          discovery shared by her husband,
          Prof. Pierre Curie, but due chiefly
          to her.
          Everybody knew that salts of
          thorium and various substances
          emnitted rays possessing the qual
          Ity of radiation, discovered by Pro
          fessor Becquerel. Madame Curie
          and her husband learned that
          pitch-blend. also produces radio
          active force that will pass through
          any substance, lead and steel ex
          S That vague information satisfied
          others, but Madame Curie was de
          termined to know just WHAT it
          was that caused the radioactivity.
          For three years she worked stead
          Ily, intensely, using in experiments
          every penny above the actual cost
          Sof keeping herself alive. In her
          work she "reduced" tons of pitch
          blende.
          At last, in 1900, in Paris, a
          watchcase was exhibited contain
          ing a speck of the world's rarest,
          most extraordinary element. It
          was labeled "Radium-Discovered
          by Madame Curie."
          .In 1911 Madame Curie obtained
          the Nobel Prise for chemistry.
          When her husband was killed in
          1906 there was no one able to take
          his place at the Sorbonne, except
          his wife, and that ancient institu
          tion broke its rule of centuries and
          Invited a woman to the full pro
          fessorship that Madame Curie now
          ,holds.
          Madame Curie is admlitted to be
          asg the greatest scientists liv

          AN IMMORTAL WOMAN
          The visit of Madam Marie Curie to this country in May
          will be celebrated by American women with the presentation
          of a thimbleful of radium to the distinguished scientist. At was
          a beautiful tribute to the modesty of womankind that Mine.
          Curie made when she discovered the element which has revo-
          lutionized physics, chemistry and some branches of medicine,
          and gave it an impersonal name. The courtesy of the labora-
          -tory dictates that the discoverer of a new thing under the sun
          may give it his own name if he wishes, and so perpetuate nia
          own glory. Mme. Curie called it radium, because it gives out
          HINTS TO GARDENERS
          More than sentiment attaches to the gift. Of course, it
          money value, something like $100,000, will have little weight
          with a devotee of science like Mme. Curie.: She will use the
          radium for scientific research. Although Mme. Curie knows
          more concerning radium and its potentialities than any living
          soul, she has not, because of her generosity, one grain with
          which to conduct experiments.
          The history of the discovery of radium is one of the most
          exalted romances that the world has ever known. The daugh-
          ter of a professor in the University of Warsaw, the present Mme.
          Curie was drawn to Paris by the magnetic pull of the renowned
          scientific schools there. In conjunction with the scientists
          Becquerel and Curie, she began a series of experiments with
          uranium which led to her discovery of radium. It also led to
          her happy marriage with Professor Curie. That the discovery
          was that of Mme. Curie alone was well established by a com-
          mission which awarded her the Nobel prize in 1903.
          The hope which radium holds out to the world is that it
          may be the means of fighting cancer, that malignant disease
          which has baffled physicians for centuries. Undoubtedly there
          are new fields into which researchers can go. And it is in these
          unexplored regions that Mme. Curie will venture. The women
          of America honor themselves by providing the means.

        <text>Today's post is guest authored by Michelle Cadoree Bradley, a science reference specialist in the Science, Technology, and Business Division of the Library of Congress.  She is also the author of the blog posts George Washington Carver and Nature Study and Stumbled Upon in the Stacks, or the Chimp in my Office.  

        On May 20, 1921 Mme. Marie Curie, who co-discovered the radium element with her husband in 1898, received from the American people an appropriate, but hazardous gift- a gram of radium.  In an interview with Mrs. W.B. (Marie) Meloney in May 1920, and later detailed The Delineator magazine in April 1921, Marie Curie disclosed that her lab had only a gram of radium to experiment with and that she needed more to continue researching. After learning about Curie's predicament,  Mrs. Meloney formed the Marie Curie Radium Fund to raise money to purchase another gram of radium, worth $100,000 (in the 1920s),  for Mme Marie Curie.  In less than a year, the Marie Curie Radium Fund secured enough donations from American women to purchase a gram of radium for Mme. Curie.

          “My husband and I were so closely united by our affection and our common work that we passed nearly all of our time together.” – Marie Curie

          Many are familiar with Marie Curie as the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person, and only woman, to win two. However, she and her husband are also noteworthy as being the first couple to win a Nobel Prize. The couple also received various other honors including the Davy Medal, the Matteucci Medal, and having the Curie symbol “Ci” (a unit of measurement in radioactivity) named after them. Together they made some of the most significant scientific discoveries of the early 1900s.

          While their accomplishments are well documented, their relationship was also the subject of admiration, and they were even described as the model married couple. This post gives a bit more insight into why that is.

          Image shows Marie and Pierre Curie seated with their daughter, Irene Curie, on a bench outside their home. The title reads: Professor and Mme. Curie and Daughter Seated in their Garden.
          “Professor and Mme. Curie and Daughter Seated in their Garden,” New-York Tribune (New York, NY), April 19, 1903.
          Marie Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw of Congress, Poland, in the Russian Empire on November 7, 1867. Her father, Wladyslaw Sklodowski, allowed her to have an educator’s influence in both the subjects of physics and mathematics from an early age. Eventually, Marie and her sister attended the Floating University, which was an illegal night school, in order to progress their education. She then worked as a governess for a few years before following her sister to Paris where she could study at the Sorbonne, also known as the University of Paris.

        <text>After describing nnd Illustrating In his
              article on Nikola Tesla's work. In the Aprl
              Century the process nnd apparatus employed
              for manipulating the electrical charge of the
              earth Itself Mr. T. C. Martin makes this
              comment on the unique phenomenon prc-
              eented Considering that In the adjus me .ts
              necessary n small length of wire or a smul
              body of any kind added to the cell or brought
              Into Its vicinity may destroy entirely al
              effect ono can Imagine the pleasure whlcl
              the Investigator feels when thus rewarded
              by unique phenomena. Aflor toarchlng with
              patient toll for two or three years after a
              result calculated In advance Mr. Tesla Is
              compensated by being able to witness a most
              magnificent display of fiery streams and light
              nlng discharges breaking out from the tip
              of the wire with the roar of a gas well
              Aside from their deep scientific Import am
              their wondrous fascination ns a spsctacle
              such effects point to many new realizations
              making for the higher welfare of the htimai
              race. The transmission of power and In
              telllgenco Is but ono thing the modification
              cf climatic conditions may be another. Per
              I chance wo. sh-all "call up" Mars In this way
              some day the electrical charge of boll
              planets being utilized In signals.
              It must not be supposed that the now clcc
              trlclty represented by Nikola Tesla Is Icono
              clastic. In the minds of a great many people
              of culture the Idea prevails that Invention Is
              as largely a process of pulling down as c
              building up and electricity.

              zlno contains nn article on "The Latest Elec-
              rlcal Inventions and Discoveries of Nikola
              Tcslarlttcn by Thomas 0. Martin cd-
              tor of tlie Electrical Engineer. The artlle
              Rives a summary of the progress made In
              electricity during the last flfty years ns
              well ns n forecast of the work of the next
              Hty years and. owing to thu destruction of
              Mr. Tesla's laboratory with all contents
              a few weeks ago Its text and Illustrations
              are now the only record of some of the In
              ventor's most. Important discoveries. One of
              the most wonderful of Tesla's Inventions Is
              he oscillator which combines the steam en-
              lne and dynamo. In speaking or It Mr
              Martin snys
              "In his oscillator Mr. Tesla has not simply
              a new practical device but a new Implement
              of scientific research. With it If he hns nets
              \s yet actually determined the earth's eUe-
              trlcal charga or 'capacity he has obtained
              striking effects which conclusively demon
              strate that he has succeeded In
              I'.sturblng It. He connects to thn earth
              one of Its ends a cell In which rapidly
              vibrating currents are produced U' other
              end being free In space. With this cell he
              does actually what one would bo doing
              with a pump forcing air Into an elastic foot
              ball. At each alternate stroke the ball wouM
              ox i niul and contract. Hut It Is evldc.it that
              such a ball If flllr-d with air Mould when
              suddenly expanded or contracted vibrate at
              Its own rate. Now If the strokes of the
              pump bo so timed that they nre In harmony
              with the Individual vibrations of the ball
              an Intense vibration or surging will be ob
              tained. The purple streamers of electricity
              thus elicited from the earth and pouring
              out to the ambient air are marvelous.
              MAGICAL HALOS.
              "The currents which are made to pass In
              and out of the earth by means of thl coil
              can also be directed upon the human body.
              An observer mounted on a chair nnd touch
              Ing the cell with a metal rod can by care
              ful adjustments divert enough of It upon
              himself to ciuse Its manifestation from nud
              around him In splinters of light. This halo

              the earth through a htiTan using the high
              est charge positively ever given In safety
              Is to say the least curious anil deeply sug
              gestive. Mr. TeslH'a temerity In trying the
              effect first uflon his own person can b3 justi
              fied only by his close anil accurate calcula
              tion of what the amount of the discharge
              from the earth would be.
              As to the econpmlc value of the oscillator

              "A moment's thought will show that one
              naln object must bs the elimination of crtaln
              steps In the raiisfer of the energy and ob
              viously. If englneji and dynamo both have
              large losses it will bp a gain to merge the
              two pieces or apparatus. The old-fashioned
              electric light station or street railway power
              house Is a giddy maze of bolls nnd shafting
              In the latter plants engine and dynamo are
              coupled directly together on one base. This
              Is a notable stride but it still Uaves us with
              a dynamo In which some part of the wire
              wound on It is not- utilized at every Instant
              and with an engine of complicated mechan
              ism. The steam cylinder with Its piston. Is
              the only thing actually doing work and nil
              the rest of the imposing collection of fly
              wheel governor balls eccentrics valves and
              what not Is fo the purpose of control and
              regulation.
              "In his oscllla or Mr. Tesla to begin with
              has stripped the engine of all thli governing
              mechanism. Dy giving also to the cells In
              which the currei Is created as they cut the
              lines of force of the magnets a. to-and-fro or
              reciprocating mo Ion so that the Influence on
              them Is equal In every direction he has over
              come the loss of the Idle part of the wire ex
              perienced In rol itlng armatures and more
              over greatest tchleveini'nt of all he has
              made the cumnts regulate the mechanical
              motions. No matter how close the governing
              of the engine that drives the ordinary dynamo
              with revolving armature there Is some Irreg
              ularity In the generation of current. In the
              Tesla oscillator. If Its Inventor and the evi
              dence of one's eyes may be believed the vibra
              tions of the current are absolutely steady and
              uniform so that one could keep the ttmo o'
              day with the machine about as well as with
              a clock.
              "Hack of the tendencies to Irregularity In
              the old-fashioned electrical apparatus were
              the equal or greater tendencies In the steam
              engine and over and above all were the
              losses duo to the Incfllcient conversion In
              both of the power released from the fuel
              under the boiler generating the steam. Gain
              In one direction with a radical Innovation
              usually means gain In many others through
              a growing series. I confess I do not know
              which of the advantages of the oscillator to
              place first and I doubt whether Its inventor
              has yet been able to sit down and sum up
              all the realities and possibilities to which It
              Is a key. Ono thing he does he presses for
              ward.
              PHOSPHORESCENT PHOTOGRAPHY
              Relativeto Tesla's experiments In pho
              tography by phosphorescence Mr. Martin
              writes
              "In the field of lighting by phosphorescence
              we reach hitherto untrodden ground. Phos
              phorescent light has been associated with the
              Idea of 'cold light or the property of becom
              Ing luminous with the omission of the Inter
              mediate step of combustion as commonly un
              derstood. Aa u physical action wo know It
              In the light of the firefly which Prof. S. P.
              Langley rates at an efficiency of 100 per cent
              nil Its radiations lying within the limits of
              the visible spectrum. Ily means of the Tcs-
              lalc currents phosphorescent light strong
              enough even to photograph by has been
              obtained nnd the picture representing
              the Inventor himself Is the llrst portrait or
              pl'Otograph of any kind ever taken by phos
              phorescent light. A bulb whose light-giving
              member Is coated with sulphldn cf zinc
              treated In a special way was rendered phos
              phorescent by means of a current obtained
              from n high-frequency transformer coll. The
              current used was alternated cr oscillated
              about 10,000 times per second. The exposure
              was about eight minutes.
              "In order to test more closely the-actlnlc
              \alue of phosphorescent light some bulbs
              subject to high frequency currents were
              photographed or. If wo may coin a new

              says "It must not bo supposed that the new

          The Electrical Review will publish tomorrow a
          communication from Nikola Tesla, de-
          scribing for the first time his very, in-
          teresting experiments in radiography.
          The scientific world has been awaiting
          an expression of opinion from Mr.
          Tesla, who is know have begun
          his experiments within jan hour after
          the news of Prof. Roentgen's discovery
          was cabled to this country. In connec
          tion with Mr. Tesla's communication
          the Electrical Review prints two re-
          markable radiographs. One of these
          shows the right shoulder of a .man
          taken through his clothing, a plate of
          glass three-sixteenths of an inch thick
          and two Inches of wood. The radio-
          graph was made at a distance of four
          feet from tne source of the X rays,
          shows the ribs, shoulder bones and
          bones of the upper arm. The other
          radiograph shows a copper wire bent
          to form the word "Roentgen," and was
          made at a distance of eleven feet from
          the wooden slide covering the sensitized
          plate. Mr. Tesla also states that the
          rare faction of Crookes tubes used in
          these experiments may be increased by
          electrical means to any degree desira
          ble, far beyond that obtained by me-
          chanical appliances. This' method he
          describes. In regard to the nature of
          X rays he says:
          "I am getting more and more con-
          vinced that we have to deal with a
          stream of material particles, which
          strike the sensitive plate with great
          velocity. Taking as a basis the esti-
          mate of Lord Kelvin on the speed of
          projected particles in a Crookes bulb,
          we arrive easily by the employment of
          very high potentials to speeds of as
          much as 100 kilometres a second. Now,
          again, the old question arises: Are the
          particles from the electrode or from
          the charged surface generally, includ-
          ing the case of an external electrode,
          projected through the glass or alumi
          num walls, or do they merely hit the
          inner surface and cause particles from
          the outside of the wall to fly off, acting
          in a purely mechanical way, as when
          a row of ivory balls is struck? So far,
          most of the phenomena indicate
          that they are projected through
          the wall of the bulb, of what-
          ever material it may be, and I am
          seeking for still more conclusive cvi-
          dence in this direction.
          EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS.
          "It is now demonstrated beyond any
          doubt that small metallic objects or
          bony or chalky deposits can be infal
          libly detected in any part of the body."
          Tesla has also secured radiographs
          showing the bony structure of birds
          and rabbits, even to the, hollow of, the
          bones. He has secured a radiograph
          of a rabbit after an hour's exposure
          in which not only every detail oi. the
          skeleton is visible.but also a clear out-
          line of the abdominal cavity, location
          of the lungs and the fur are shown.
          Radiographs of large birds show the
          feathers distinctly. In another in-
          stance an exposure of forty minutes
          gave a radiograph of the human skull,
          showing clearly not only the outline,
          but the cavity of the eye, chin, cheek,
          nasal bones, lower jaw and count c-
          tions to the upper one, the vetebral
          column and connections to the skull,
          the flesh and even the hair."
          Mr. Tesla concludes his. communica
          tion in the following., interesting
          words: 'y
          "By exposing the head to a power-
          ful radiation strange effects have been
          noted. For instance, I find that there
          is a tendency to sleep, ,and the time
          seems to pass away quickly. There is
          a general soothing effect, and I have
          felt a sensation of warmth in the up-
          per part of the head. .An assistant
          independently confirmed the tendency
          to sleep and a quick lapse of time.
          Should these remarkable effects be
          verified by men of keener sense of ob-
          servation, I shall still more firmly be-
          lieve in the existence j of '-material
          streams penetrating the skull. Thud
          it may be possibl3 by these strange
          appliances to project a -suitable chem
          ical into any part of the body.

        <text>In this period of wide nnd perhaps ex

              Prof. Roentgen In photographing shadow ef
              fects through solids It Is Interesting to

              than sound waves of electrified air. And this
              statement ho made as far back as 1891.
              Sound waves of electrified air what docs
              this mean Let ua go back to fundamental
              principles Every one knows that when a
              bell Is struck the round Is carried to the
              oar by wave vibrations traveling through the
              air. The higher the pitch cf the bell the
              greater becomes the numbsr ot BDUnd vibra
              tions per second and the higher on the scale In
              the resulting tone. And it Is a well es
              tablished fact that sound vibrations may occur
              with such rapidity aa to pass beyond the
              ordinary Tango of hearing nnd become In
              audible. Most potple for Instance nro unable
              to hear sounds produced by vibrations of
              moro than twenty thousand to the second
              although a few persons with exceptional
              hearing Mr. Telsw himself Is ruch a per
              son can detect sound of thirty thousand vi
              brations or even more. And naturalslst
              bring evidence t prove that certain animals
              or Insects are gifted with the capacity ot
              detecting sounds far beyond these Indeed
              there is no known limit to the ran KG ot
              theoretical sound the limitations being all
              In the human car.
              H Is on this theory that Mr. Tcsla regards
              these cathode rays with their Incredibly
              swift vibrations as being really sound waves
              producing audlblo tones to any ear capable
              of hearing them.
              TESLA HEARD CATHODE RAYS.
              Of course the tremendous elevation of
              these sounds duo to vibrations of. say 100-
              000 In a second makes It Impossible for any
              human being fully to hear them and yet
              owing perhaps to the years which ho hnl
              pascsd In solitude In the laboratory under
              the most intense nervous tension Mr. Tcsla
              has 'on various occasions heard
              some of there strange sound wavea.
              Doubtless they were the lower ones
              but their tones came distant to
              bis car with amazing fineness hut clear
              as n distant bell. It Is likely that no other
              man ever hoard sounds ot such high vibra
              tion and Mr. Tesla noted with surpiso that
              the mere hearing of these sounds produced
              a strange effect upon him and tended to
              induce sleep. Repeatedly he strained his
              onrs to listen and each time success was
              followed by the fcamo peaceful lulling sensa-
              tlon and strange to say each tlmo as he
              nas at the very point of sinking into un
              consciousness the sound grew louder In Ills
              brain as If to show that the cerebral center
              of hearing becomes more acutely sensitive
              at the moment of passing from waking Into
              sleep.What
              What makes ft prohablo that the cathode
              rays are rapidly vibrating sound waves trans
              mitted through the air and "hot ether waves
              as others have affirmed is the well estab
              lished fact that light which moves through
              the ether will not penetrate certain solids
              but that sound which moves through the
              ar will penetrate roost of these solids
              Furthermore It has long been known that
              the bcnsltlzed photographic plato is chemi
              cally affected by certain sounds even those
              audible to the ear and experiments now
              being carried on by Mr Tcsla and others
              are likely to demonstrate conclusively that
              neither electricity nor unseen light waves
              or chemical rays but .sound waves are the
              causa of the phenomena pointed out by Prof.
              Roentgen.
              From this It becomes plain that electricity
              has no necessary relation to tlisBo shadow
              photographs. Neither Oiave the Crookes
              tubes. They ao useful at present Indeed
              essential as the form the moat convenient
              nieana of throwing- the air Into a state of
              such rapid vibration as will produce effects
              upon the sensitized plate. Hut a tuning
              Fork would do this Just as well so Mr. Tesla
              thinks' If one could bo made that would
              produce a sound ot 100,000 vibrations In n
              becond or a bell of corresponding pitch
              would answer equally or any other mechani
              cal device which would set the air vibrating
              at such enormous rapidity.
              PRODUCED WITHOUT CROOKES TUI3C3.
              There la no doubt Mr. Tcsla says that
              he Crookes tubes might be entirely dU-
              cnod with In taking tlieao shadow pn

              equal force the shot remaining Inside \vll

              commotion. The Grooves tube docs cxactl
              that for the particles of air. preventing
              them from crowding upon the wire by pour
              ing out mosl of them that Is by creating
              what Is called a vacuum but what Is really
              only a glass tube filled with rarefied air.
              The wire of the circuit being introduced
              Into this thin air- buffets Its particles about
              under the blows of Its swift alternations
              with far greater effectiveness than would be
              possible were It left to sXrlku against the
              heavier layers of ordinary air. The differ
              ence Is as great In the case of a prize
              fighter trying to strike a blow under water
              or again In the air.
              NO CATHODE RAYS IN A VACUUM.
              It may bo demonstrated however that the
              efficiency of the Crookes tube In .producing
              the cathode rays Is due to the vibrations of
              the particles of rarefied air within and that
              w'thout such rarefied air particles there
              cculd be no production of the rays. Mr.
              Tesla has shown this In an Ingenious ap
              paratus devised by himself by turning an
              alternating current Into a Crookes tube In
              \\hlch has been produced nn absolutely per
              fect vacuum something regarded ns unat1-
              tal ablo. by most scientists but possible to
              him. From such a Crookes tube no cathode
              rays whatever are found to emerge for the
              simple reason that the alternating shocks
              from the wire having no medium to act upon
              produce no effect upon the surrounding glass
              tube and hence none upon the outside air.
              I suggested to Mr. Tesla that It might be
              posslblo to demonstrate his theory that the
              cathode rays are really sound waves of elec
              trified air by Introducing a perfect vacuum
              tubs In the ordinary apparatus for photo
              graphing shadow pictures and causing the
              rays to pass through this vacuum before
              Impinging on the photographic film. It Is
              known of course Ural ether waves will tra
              verse a vacuum while sound waves will not
              and It would seem that this new theory
              would thus bs put to the test since If the
              plato was affected by the rays In splto of
              the vacuum. It would show that they were
              not sound waves while If the vacuum pre
              vented It from be-i-g sensitized then Mr.
              Tesla's view would be sustained.
              "Such an experiment would be InterestIng
              Ing he said "but It would not be con
              clusive since the cathode rays once started
              move with such Incredible velocity that they
              would jump through any ordinary vacuum.
              I estimate that the air particles In a Crookes
              tube set In vibration by a high potential cur
              rent arc hurled back and forth at the rate
              of from three to flvo kilometers a second.
              In order to overcome this great momentum
              It would be necessary to produce n vacuum
              occupying a considerable space and that Is
              not easy to do. Still I am sure that before
              long the scientific world will recognize that
              these cathode rays are the Identical sound
              wavea of electrified air which I announced
              years ago.

          TeslAis a young man He has just
          I pas fcfl Jils fortieth birthday If he lives
          20 years or more and retains his facul
          ties th world will be a different placQ
          to livejin compared with today His
          i ideas and W projects are so big that it
          takes time to grasp their real imoort
          He talks as calmly of producing a flash
          of lightning a mile long as the ordi
          nary man speaks of telegraphing to
          Chicago Not long ago in his labora
          tory he said I expect to live to be
          able to set a machine in the middle
          of this room and move it by the energy
          of no other agency than the medium
          in motion around us
          This sounds like the vaporings of a
          dreamer It means a perpetual motion
          machine and that in itself is enough
          to stamp Tesla in the minds of ordi
          nary men as a fullfledged visionary
          I But Tesla is the very acme of prac
          ticality in all things except money
          making If he wished he could be a
          millionaire five times over As it is
          there are dozens of ordinary mechanics
          within a mile of his laboratory who
          could buy and sell him six times over
          If every man said Tesla who uses
          my machine in electroterafy alone
          would give me a quarter of a dollar I
          would be very wealthy I have never
          received a dollar for it and there is
          no way in which I could
          Tesla is I strange in all things He
          will talk willingly about electrical in
          ventions of the past present and fu
          ture but it is like drawing teeth to
          t him to say a word about himself
          He has a genuine distaste for notoriety
          when Tesla the man is concerned and
          politely asks to bo let alone
          He ts a Montenesran by birth His
          father was a man of unusual mental
          attainments and his mother had the
          inventive genius to a considerable de
          gree I am not much of a linguist
          says Tesla I speak but six or seven
          or eight languages My father spoke
          18 and besides he was a remarkable
          mathematician
          Tesli is tall thin and lanky but
          quick and impulsive in manner and
          earnest in speech He is not much of
          a talker but every word he utters
          means something His head is big
          and bony and his ears stick out He
          is not a handsome man by any means
          but he is impressive His hair is as
          black as hair can be and is coarse and
          rumnled i
          Physically he does not appear tc he
          robust but he says his constitution IS
          rugged and he can stand almost any
          strain In his youth he was a famous
          wrestler He went in for all kinds of
          sport The Montenegrans are rare
          gamblers and Tesla inherited the na
          tional love of excitement over the card
          table More than once in those days
          he went through single sittings of
          48 hours at a stretch and then only
          stopped because theother players had
          succumbed
          I know the fascination of play he
          said but all the allurements of the
          game are insipid to me compared with
          the overmastering excitement of life
          in the laboratory No thrill can go
          through the human frame like that felt
          by the Inventor as he sees the creation
          of his brain unfolding to success after
          months and years of waiting and hop
          Ing So Tesla dots not gamble now
          at least not over the card table His
          laboratory supplies all the excitement
          that his emotion can stand
          Teslas father was a clergyman of
          the Greek church and it was intended
          that the son should fit himself for thE
          same life The idea of entering tin
          ministry was opposed by the boy with
          such pertinacity that at last his father
          compromised by agreeing that hi
          should become a nrofessor or mathe
          matics and physics With that end ir
          view Tesla was sent to the Polytech
          nic institute at Gratz and there ii
          operation was a gramme dynamo
          That smple electrical instrument th
          first that he had seen settled the fea
          ture calling of Tesla.

          I inventions a rotating field motor
          The world owes a debt of gratitude
          to the little gramme dynamo as it in
          stigated the fundamental idea which
          subsequent eiaoorattons and perfec
          tions by Tesla made possible several
          of the grandest mechanical feats that
          the world has ever known When
          Tesla first came to this country little
          I was known of the alternating current
          and electrical energy was delivered almost
          tel r el
          most entire b the continubus cur
          rent system This is a successful
          method for short line work but where
          the power IR to be transmitted to a
          considerable distance it is imnractic
          able
          One of Teslas inventions based
          upon his first Idea was an alternating
          current motor that nermitted the
          transmission of energy long distances
          at high pressure over the wires This
          invention made possible the bridling
          of the power in Niagara and natural
          forces by its use can be harnessed
          everywhere Originally it was thought
          necessary to employ two wires for the
          transmission of powerone to convey
          it and the other to return it Tesla
          proved that the second wire was a
          needless expense and that the energy
          could be transmitted with one wire
          with smiller waste than with two
          The bulk of Teslas income is de
          rived from his invention in the rotat
          ing field and it is not a large income
          either He also receives a small sum
          from his fathers estate and these are
          the sum total of his pecuniary re
          sources Ninetenths of this money
          goes into his laboratory work He

          I j lionized by his hostess and the guests
          I and spent the most unhappy hour of
          I his life Since then he has avoided
          social functions with assiduous care
          I After leaving the school at Gratz
          Tesla went to Paris but he attracted
          j little attention because his Ideas were
          then in their infancy and were of such
          I magnificent calibre that the mere men
          c
          h
          tion of them made the leading French
          electricians regard their originator as
          a fanciful dreamer Some friend ad
          vised him to come to America This
          he did and hunting up Thomas A
          Edison soon convinced that genius
          that he was a valuable man to employ
          Teslas stay with Edison was brief
          He had his own ideas and it is be
          loved they clashed with Edisons
          Tesla has never said much about this
          Right here it should be mentioned that
          the Montenegrins has not the jealousy
          common among inventors He never
          jellttles the work of any man and he
          has done more for young electricians
          Just starting out than any other dozen
          men of his Drcfession

          NEW YORK, Nov. S.— Nikola Tesla.
          tbe electrical expert, in a newspaper
          Interview describes an application of
          •ricity whereby, without the inter
          f tion of any artful medium of com
          n Qnlcatlon, one man may control and
          direct, with absolute exactitude, the
          ments of any type of vessel, bal
          loon or land vehicle at any distance
          may be desired. From a a
          on shore, or frmn the deck of a vessel
          r way. a torpedo boat equipped with
          Mr. Tesia's controlling device may be
          propelled either on or below the sur-
          face, maneuvered at will In any direc
          tion; and finally brought into contact
          and exploded against the side of a hos
          tile vessel at any point within the
          range of the vision of the operator.
          than this, assuming that it were
          .possible to accurately locate the posi
          tion of the vessel which it is desired to
          y. the torpedo boat could be di
          rected to it, even if the ship lay in the
          harbor of Southampton and the opera
          tor was stationed at Sandy Hook.
          Mr. Tesla says that some months
          elapsed since he fully dev
          his device, for which he has applied for
          a patent. When it was learned thai Ad
          miral Cervera was bottled up at Santi
          :t was his intention to apply his
          anism to several launches and
          similar craft loaded with high explo
          and to annihilate the fleet at an
          chor. Admiral Cervera, however, came
          out and met his fate under the guns of
          .uerican fleet befort ssary
          arrangements could be made. Then Mr.
          T>-p!a planned a raid on the Spanish
          Vessels in Havana harbor, only t i be
          thwartvl by the proclamation of the
          nsion of hostilities. Says Mr.
          1
          "Hithen-' the only means of control
          ling the movements of a vessel from a
          nee have been supplied through
          the medium of a flexible conductor.
          Buch as an electric cable, but this Bys
          t':~i is subject t" obvious limitations,
          such as are Imposed by the length,
          ht and strength of the conductor
          which can be practically us"d; by the.
          difficulty of maintaining with safety
          the high speed of the vessel or chang
          he direction <>f her movements
          ■jvith rapidity: th" necessity of effect
          from a point which is
          ticaliy fixed. and from many other
          Lacks which are inseparably con-
          nected -with such a system.
          "The rTrt'n whfch I have perfected in
          volves none of these objections, tori
          am enabled by the use of my invention
          tn employ any means of prppulsl
          impart to the moving body or v<
          the highest possible speed, to
          peration of its machinery and to i
          direct its movements from either a
          fixed point ex from a body moving and
          '■hanging its direction, however rapid-
          I\ and to maintain this control over*
          distances without any artificial
          connections between the vessel and the
          apparatus governing its movements.
          and without such restrictions as these
          must necessarily Impose.
          "In a broad Bense, then, my invention
          differs from all of those systems which
          r the control of the mechan
          ism carried by a moving object and
          governing 1 its motion in that 1 require
          no intermediate, wires, cables or other
          form of electrical or mechanical conaec
          w Ith the object save the natural
          media in space-. I accomplish, never
          theless, similar results and in a much
          more practical manner by producing
          waves, impulses or radiations which are
          received through the t j ;irth, water or
          atmosphere by suitable apparatus on
          t!i" moving body and which cause the
          d actions, so long as the body re
          s within the active region or ef
          fective range of such currents, waves,
          impulses or radiations.

          Elevated on slicks on a table in the.
          j center of the laboratory stood a model
          I of a screw-propelled craft, about four
          j feet long and somewhat disproportion
          ately wide and deep. Mr. Tesla ex
          plained that it was merely a working
          model which he had made in order to
          exhibit it to President McKinley, and
          that no attempt had been made to fol
          low the usual sharp lines of a torpedo
          boat. The deck was slightly arched
          and surmounted by three slender
          standards, the center one being con
          siderably higher than the other two,
          which carried small incandescent bulbs,
          a third bulb being fixed at the bow.
          The keel consisted of a massive cop
          pel i late, the propeller and' rudder be
          ing in the usual positions. Mr. Tesla
          explained that the boat contained the
          lling machinery, consisting
          electric motor actuated by a storage
          battery in the hold, another motor to
          actuate the rudder and the delicate
          mechanism which performs the func
          tion of receiving through the central
          standard the electric impulses sent
          i through the atmosphere from the dis
          tant operating station which set in mo-
          I tion the propelling and steering mo
          j tors, and ihrough them light or extin-
          I guish the electric bulbs and fire the ex
          ploding charge in a chamber in the bow
          in response to signals sent by the ope
          rator.
          "Now watch," said the Inventor, and
          going to a table on the other side of
          the room, on which lay a little switch
          board, about five inches square, he gave
          the lever a sharp turn. Instantly the
          little bronze propeller began to revolve
          at a furious rate.
          "Now I will send the boat to star
          board," he said, and another quick
          movement of the' lever sent the helm
          sharp over, and another movement
          i turned it as rapidly back again. At an
          other signal the screw stopped and re
          versed.
          "During the day," continued Mr.
          Tesla, his hand on the lever, "we should
          j steer our course by keeping the two
          I standards in line, but at night we
          I should depend upon the electric iights,
          which would, of course, be screened so
          as not to be visible to the enemy," and
          at a signal both the tiny bulbs were il
          luminated.
          "Now we will assume that tho boat
          I has arrived withi.i striking distance of
          the vessel to be destroyed and the bulb
          in the bow will serve to show that the
          explosion has taken place."
          As he spoke he touched the lever
          I again and the light flashed and was ex-
          I tinguished.
          "Imagine, if you can." said Mr. Tesla,
          as he went back to his desk, "what an
          irresistible instrument of destruction
          we have in a torpedo boat thus con
          tr lied, which we can operate day or
          night, on the surface or below it and
          from any distance that may be desired.
          A ship thus assailed would have no pos
          sible show of escape.
          "I can apply this system of control to
          any type of vessel and any one of any
          size. It is not even necessary to make
          a close approach to be destroyed. At
          j the distance of 100 feet the explosion
          of ?00 pounds of dynamite will exert a
          I shattering effect on a battleship, but
          there is no reason w>»~ we should not
          I load a. vessel with 200 or 300 tons or
          (even more of dynamite, which, explod
          ed even a mile or so way would raise
          a wave that would overwhelm the big
          si ship ever built.

          Tesla`s Latest Wonder
          TKSLA'S latest electrical wonder
          is out. It Is out because he ba.«
          just received patents on It in
          this and other countries.
          What Tesla proposes to do
          now is to transmit almost any amount
          of power almost any distance without
          wires, and without loss. Although
          moving ships at sea may use the sys
          tem for propulsion it is mainly intend
          ed for use on land.
          To illustrate the anticipated results
          in the most concrete form it is pro
          posed, for instance, that water power
          shall generate a great quantity of
          electricity on the lower courses of
          streams coming from the Sierras; that
          this electricity shall be conducted to a
          balloon arrangement floating a mile or
          two above the earth; that there shall
          be in San Francisco a similar balloon
          high above the city and that all the
          el-'itrical energy conducted to the first
          balloon shall pass without loss and
          without wires to the balloon over the
          city, from which it shall descend to
          turn wheels and light lamps, etc.
          A secondary result would seem to be
          that ships minus boilers and minus
          coal shall plow their way from the
          Golden Gate to Puget Sound, their
          churning propellers being driven by
          motors which draw their energy
          through the air from stations arranged
          every hundred miles or so along the
          shore.
          This may seem a crazy idea to some
          people, but then it was a more crazy
          idea once that a man's voice should
          be heard 2000 miles away and that a
          waterfall should turn a mill a hundred
          miles away, and besides Nikola Tesla
          says so and he is acknowledged as one
          of the very best electric experts in the
          country.
          In one sense Tesla is a greater wizard
          than Edison. They are twin wizards
          in the wondrous field of electrical sci
          ence, but they are wholly unlike. Edi
          son is wholly practical and he cares for
          nothing that he cannot make a com
          mercial BUCO6S& His spur is not devo
          tion to science as it was with FYank-
          Ifn, Faraday, Volta, Galvani and the
          rest. Tesla is rather Edison's reverse
          as a genius. He plunges into electrical
          mystery and seeks scientific facts, phe
          nomena, laws and principles rather
          than patents though he looks uut for
          the patents when they are in sight.
          Young Tesla has startled the world
          about as much as has Edison, but you
          d^n't find his name on the patent plates
          of as many machines about town. He
          made electrical engineers marvel by
          smilingly passing a milliun volts of
          electricity through his body and he
          showed them how to light a room bril
          liantly with a simple empty glass tube
          which he held In his hand or laid on
          the table without any connecting wires.
          In various ways he has led the sci
          entific world far toward the final mys
          tery of this "form of radiation." This
          latest advance of his is both scientific
          and practical.
          "Tesla's Bystem of electric power
          transmission through natural media"
          is the descriptive title of this latest in
          vention of his.

          In the wireless telegraphy an appar
          atus sends out in all directions through
          air, buildings, earth and water a series
          of "Hertzian waves as a lighthouse
          lamp sends out light waves The
          length and frequency are regulated
          and the receiving apparatus, if adapt
          ed to these waves, responds as one
          tuning fork will to its like. In this
          case the electrical phenomena proceed
          in all directions like sound or ripples
          from where a stone strikes in the
          water.
          Tesla, however, proposes to generate
          energy at one point and pass it all
          Generating Eiectric Energy by Water Power Out in tbe Mountains.
          Illustrating the method by Which Electric Power Is Conducted From One Place to
          Another Without Wares, The Balloons Act as the Poles of the Dynamos and the Current
          Flashes Across Through the Rarefied Air,
          without loss through the air direct to
          a distant point, where it may be used
          for light or power. A comprehension
          of his invention depends upon an un
          derstanding of "voltage."
          An electric current may be large in
          quantity and low in intensity or small
          in quantity and high in intensity as a
          stream of water be large in volume and
          slow of motion or may be small and
          rapid. A stream of water an inch in
          diameter will exert more power than a
          small river if the pressure is great
          enough:
          In handling electricity quantity is re
          duced to intensity and the reverse by
          means of "transformers." In long-dis
          tance transmission of power the energy
          is transformed to a high intensity or
          voltage and then sent over the wires,
          and where it is received it is again
          transformed to a lower voltage and
          greater quantity for use.
          Here is another preparatory Illustra
          tion. Most people have seen electric
          sparks Jump from one brass ball to
          another in electrical apparatus. The
          distance these sparks will jump de
          pends not on the amount of electricity
          generated but on its Intensity or volt-
          age.
          Now, there are two things which
          mainly underlie Tesla's new scheme.
          One is the production of voltages be
          fore hardly dreamed of, ani the other
          is the increased conductivity of the air
          ,when it is rarefied as it is at high alti
          tuftes.
          Up to date 15,000 volts has been the
          measure of the intensity at which elec
          tric power has been transmitted over
          copper wires, though now they are
          talking of doubling it. Tesla proposes
          to transmit it without wires at 2,500,000
          volts or more. At this voltage a given
          quantity transmitted would produce
          about 200 times the ordinary amount of
          power when reduced with transform
          ers.
          It Is a well-known laboratory fact
          that rarefied air is a conductor of elec
          tricity, though one of much resistance.
          The Crookes tubes of X ray fame de
          pend on this principle. "With one sweep

          Tesla takes this principle from the
          laboratories where, only, men have put
          it to use, and goes up to the clouds
          with it He produces a wonderful volt
          age that will Jump an enormous dis
          tance in every-day air, and proposes to
          take it in balloons up to where the air is
          a sort of natural Crook.es tube. In auch
          an altitude it will Jump long distances
          to another terminal, he says, the layer
          of heavy air below being a non-con
          ductor and resisting It like the rubber
          wrapping of a wire, for ordinary air is
          not a good conductor.
          Tesla is the pioneer of high voltages.
          Some time ago he invented an "oscilla
          tor a purely Tesla contrivance, for
          this purpose. He has been making
          them bigger and bigger and his last one
          gets up to 2,500,000 volts. The accom
          panying illustration shows his latest
          oscillator in action.
          The diagrams illustrate the theory of
          the apparatus. In the transmitting ap
          paratus A is an insulated high tension
          coll about a magnetic core. C is a
          second coil of larger wire. The ter
          minals of both coils are shown. G is
          the generator or source of current. D
          is a balloon acting as a terminal itself
          or a terminal supported by a balloon
          to which the current passes. The cur
          rent is supposed to pass through the
          rarefied upper air from D to Dl, a re
          ceiving balloon at a great distance.
          The primary and secondary coils of the
          receiving apparatus are the reverse of
          the transmitter. L and M indicate
          lamps and motors to be energized by
          the transmitted current.

          trical pressure of two and a

          by the luminous streams fron)
          the single terminal is over
          sixteer) feet.
          panying the inventor's application for
          a patent it is said that the invention
          comprises a novel method for the
          transmission of electrical energy with
          out the employment of metallic line
          conductors, but the results arrived at
          are of such character and magnitude
          as compared with any heretofore se
          cured as to render indispensable the
          employment of means and the utiliza
          tion of effect! essentially different in
          their chara .eristics and actions from
          those before used or investigated.
          The systems depend, he says, on "ex
          clusively high pressures," but he has
          devised means to generate with safety
          and ease pressures measured by mil
          lions of volts. Then he states some
          thing that electrical engineers know
          mighty little about. He says:
          "F^rst, that with electrical pressures
          of the magnitude and character which
          I have made it possible to produce, the
          ordinary atmosphere becomes, in
          a measure, capable of servine as a true,
          conductor; se-nd, that the conduc
          tivity of the air increases so materi
          ally with the increase of electrical
          pressure and degree of rarefaction that
          it becomes possible to transmit
          through even moderately rarefied
          strata of the atmosphere electrical en
          ergy up to practically any amount and
          to any distance."
          If Tesla can bring electrical energy
          through the air in "any amount and to
          any distance" he can get a big contract
          out here in California next week. But
          for all anybody knows we will soon be
          sending up balloons about the bay to
          catch the thunderbolts hurled from
          balloons away in the mountains, and
          be laughing at the poor colliers that
          will have to go into the lumber trade.
          "If there be high mountains in the
          vicinity," says Mr. Tesla, "the termin
          als should be at a greater height."
          Electrical engineers seen yesterday
          declined to discuss this wonderful prop
          osition for publication Just yet, but said
          that they had no doubt that something
          of the sort would be done one of thesu
          days. It is, in fact, quite likely that
          future generations will look back with
          curious interest on theße days where
          people used poles and wires for elec
          tricity and pictures and samples will
          be stowed In museums like old armor
          and the first steam engines.
          Mr. Tesla's Invention for handling
          vessels at sea without there being any
          body on board differs slightly
          from the apparatus for trans
          mitting power across land with
          out the use of wires. In the
          latter the principle of overcoming re
          sistance by placing the electrode high
          In air where there is little resistance is
          made use of. Just what principle is
          used In the movement of vessels is not
          clearly explained in the telegraphic re
          ports from the Inventor, but it would
          appear to be some application of the
          DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING THE PRINCIPLE

          principle that causes an X ray to glow
          even when removed several feet from

          is it is one of the greatest wonders of
          the age and surely destined to revolu
          tionize warfare.
          In speaking of his ship moving and
          handling invention Tesla said:
          "Hitherto the only means of control
          ling the movements of a vessel from a
          distance have been supplied through
          the medium of a flexible conductor,
          such as an electric cable, but this sys
          tem is subject to obvious limitations,
          such as are imposed by the length,
          weight and- strength of the conductor
          which can be practically used; by the
          difficulty of maintaining with safety
          the high speed of the vessel or chang
          ing the direction of her movements
          with rapidity; the necessity of effect-
          Ing the control from a point which Is
          practically fixed, and from many other
          drawbacks which are inseparably con
          nected with such a system.
          "The plan which I have perfected In
          volves none of these obiections, for I
          am enabled by the use of my invention
          to employ any means of propulsion to
          impart to the moving body or vessel
          the highest possible speed, to control
          the operation of its machinery and to
          direct its movements from either a
          fixed point or from a body moving and
          changing its direction, however rapid
          ly, and to maintain this control over

          THE promise made by Nikola Tesla to the world some
          two years ago that he would soon give it a means
          of lighting its homes, its offices and its streets at
          night time by "artificial daylight" has been fulfilled.
          The invention has been entirely completed for
          several weeks. A day or two ago the authoritative an-
          rouncement was made that contracts have already been
          signed with several New York business houses to equip
          their business places with the new light at once. The
          promoters of the company which Is pushing the new in
          vention are so certain of its great practical utility that
          they predict that it must soon supplant the arc lamp.
          "Vacuum tube lighting by high frequency currents" is
          ■what Tesla himself calls it. The name, though clumsy.
          Is sufficiently descriptive. The essential parts are a va
          cuum tube, and a special current of high frequency, pro
          duced by a special dynamo, of Tes'.a's invention. The
          tubes," Mr. Tesla explains, "have had all the air pumped
          out, but, of course, are full of ether. The passage of this
          special current sets the other in motion, lorming light
          waves. The light differs frem arc Illumination in that it
          has no particular center. The whole tube glows and sheds
          a radiance like daylight all around."
          The tubes, of course, are sealed tight at both end;:. A
          wire is made fast to one end. but there !s no wire inside.
          The tubes at present in use are about a foot long. For
          spe< lai purposes, such as studio illumination, street light
          int,' and so <>n. they can be made any size up to a yard.
          The glory and the beauty of them is that their light
          goes all over the place to be illumined is as strong in
          the corners of a room as directly under the. tube. Hence
          the truth of its name, artificial daylight. A hinted tube
          in a room has exactly the effect of daylight flooding the
          windows. Notwithstanding the tube itself is not trying
          to the eyes. You may look steadily at it, with no evil
          effects whatever.
          In I 9 "P.i lighting 97 per cent of the electric cur
          rent go.-s to making the filament hot. leaving but 3 per
          cent for illumination. And this brings us to a second long
          advantage of the vacuum tube. It never grows hot. You
          may touch the glass an hour after the light is turned on
          and find it as cool as when first lighted. An electric bulb
          in like case is hot enough to scorch, not to mention giving
          headaches to the luckless mortals who happen to Bit di
          rectly underneath or beside it.
          The tubes can be attached to the electric light fixtures
          In common use, but cannot be illumined by the ordinary
          current. Or rathpr they can be made to glow with it, but
          the process is too costly. That was one thing that made
          the wise men doubtful in the beginning. A few of them
          thought Tesia might probably perfect his light process,
          but were firm in the belief that it would remain too costly
          for commercial use.
          Tesla's new dynamo has changed all that. Contracts
          now signed insure that several important structures in
          New York city will be quipped with the new light.
          There can bo no doubt that it will rapidly supplant
          other methods of illumination as soon as moneyed men
          build ard operate high frequency current stations. The
          first cost of wires, tubes, etc., is about the same as for
          incandescent lighting, hut the tubes have the very great
          virtue of not burning; out after the manner of incandescent
          globes or carbon pencils, hence the cost of operation will
          be very much less.
          When it comes to use there is simply no comparison
          Possible. It is just the same as having a day twenty-four
          hours lon'i. Everywhere, for every purpose, artificial day
          light equals th I* al thing.
          Witness this picture of the inventor's hand. The pho
          tograph for it nas made at midnight, in his laboratory,
          with B two-v?cotd exposure. It was not only taken, but
          printed by the artificial daylight, yet it will be seen that
          it shows clearly the line* of the palm and the texture of
          cuff and Bleeve.
          Nothing remains r-nw but to equip the world with
          pronei wires, dynamos, r>nd so on. Men with money know
          a good thing when they see it, ever without artificial
          daylight, so it is very Hkery th:it in a matter of twelve
          months there will l> practically no night in any con
          siderable city of the world.

          WITH a hand so liberally endowed with all the essential qualities, Tesla
          111 fOUlr not ue l ess tban -famous. His phenomenally strong fate line would
          111 give promise of an exceptional career— one where the Inventor not only
          VAy wins honors, but can make a financial success of his undertakings.
          His hand embodies all the salient points of the conic or artistic type,
          with the scientific or Inventive, as Indicated by the breadth at the base of the
          hand and the well-defined lines on the Mount of Mercury. His tapering fingers
          lend artistic beauty to his inventive genius. His long third finger gives him
          enough of a speculative spirit to enable him to "launch out into the deep" and
          grasp the slightest straw which might develop Into something tangible. Yet
          his head line, keeping a normal course and following his life line so closely,
          would indicate his caution and his disposition to submit all things to reason.
          His head lino, rising slightly under the Mount of the Sun, would point more
          clearly to great fame and, with the added triangle upon the line, to great distinc
          tion and public honors, ills head line, not drooping to the Mount of the Moon,
          would preserve him from the defect of most inventive geniuses— he would not be
          come visionary. Everything must bn practical to appeal to him. This Is also
          borne out in his continuous Girdle of Venus, which gives inspiration and enthu
          siasm. He is capable of rising to the greatest pitch of enthusiasm, yet the square
          palm and level head line would never allow him to become a dreairwr. He has,
          to be sure, a high appreciation of the fine arts; but after all It Is the natural he
          desires and will have. He has enough commercial ability to protect his own In
          terests.
          He is changeable in moods, quick to take offense, and has a tendency to
          lapse into periods of gloom, because of his tendency to plan far beyond his
          power to execute.
          While he is developing or materializing one invention he is planning and ar
          ranging in his mind something entirely different from the work on hand. And
          yet he has the ability to keep all in order and never allows one plan to inter
          fort- with another. He has great powers of concentration and the long second
          phalanx of the thumb would cause him to submit all to a careful analysis and ar
          rive at n logical conclusion before acting upon a matter of importance. He has
          a forceful, energetic temperament, possessing all of the desirable qualities of an
          artistic nature with scientific and commercial ability.
          Vie has a Latin thumb, which endows him with intellect and refinement. In
          the attainment of a desire or the carrying out of a plan he would use the ptregth
          of Intellectual will as opposed to that of brute force. Yet he is a man who would
          brook no opposition and would be inclined to be aggressive when an important
          matter was under consideration. It would not be easy to manage or control such
          a nature. He is generous and frank with those who win his confidence. He is
          adaptable to places and people and really prefers a bohemian existence, as shown
          by the position of the fourth finger. He has great diplomacy and tact In his
          management of people, using quiet but determined methods. He is one whoso
          nature is so highly organized that he cannot endure discord of any kind. He
          would sacrifice a good deal for peace and the lines show plainly that his life baa
          not been on-? uninterrupted harmonious existence. In his early career he met with
          somo opposition; the influence of relatives played quite a part In his early lifo.
          One influence especially (as indicated by the downward branch of the heart lino)
          caused his sorrow.
          Tesla is a man of deep affection, loving more from the Imagination than
          from the senses, and one who has been disappointed by his idol falling far short
          of his estimate. He has the highest type of affection, the pride and worship of
          the heart's ideal, and an equal ambition that the woman of his choice shall be
          great, noble and sincere.
          He has great determination, perseverance, patience and keen perception. He
          will start upon a new lino of work at 45 and Invent something which will startle
          the entire world. It will be five years before it will be fully matured, owing to a
          period of illness, which for a time will interfere with his progress. The illness
          will be in the form of nervous exhaustion, as shown by the' large downward
          branch from the line of life. He will recover, however, and win his choicest
          laurels after that, as shown by the fate line doubling itself. From that time
          on he will have great wealth and the highest honors conferred upon him
          He will end his life far from his native country.

          Says Julian Hawthorne:
          "Apart from love and religion there
          happened the other day to Mr. Tesla the
          most momentous experience that has

          THE HEAL QUESTION.
          The real question, however, is how will
          these interplanetary communications be
          conducted: what the medium to be em?
          ployed: with such interplanetary com?
          munication as is propos?e*, electricity will
          doubtless be revealed as but tlie fraction?
          al aspect of a force possessing a vastly
          irrealer .scop?? and power than have any
          of the phenomena of our experiments yet
          revealed to us. The energy of man's
          brain, if properly applied, may suffice to
          propogate waves of meaning from one end
          of the universe to the other, and science
          will unquestionably aid.
          Nicola Tesla promises us communication
          with our terrestrial nc-igbors. How, when
          and where? remain to be seen.

          will soon be awarded
          The chief essentials of Tcslas syEtem
          are a transmitter and a receiver with
          the earth as the connecting medium Both
          transmitter and receiver are rather simple
          machines or at any rate look so on his
          patent The transmitter which is set up
          at one point receives the electricity from
          the source of power Intensifies It and
          sends it through a wire into the earth
          throngh which It passes away In all di
          rect ons
          At a distant point from the transmitter
          say in London for Instance a receiver is
          cet up This Is adjusted so that Its vibra
          tions are In unison with the vibrations of
          the transmitter Being in tune as Tesla
          callj It the receiver catches up from the
          earth tho currents from the particular
          transmitter on the opposite side of the
          Atlantic magnifying them many thousand
          times
          The cost of telegraphing by the wire
          less system will Tesla says be much less
          than by tho cable system and messages
          may be sent much more quickly Through
          the use of certain artifices It will be mada
          Impossible for a receiver in Calcutta for
          Instance to take up tho current carrying
          a message to London
          Just where the first wireless telegraph

              New York, Feb. 28. Probably no such
              popular furore for a purely scientifio dis
              covery was ever excited before as has
              grown out of the exploitation of the new
              photography with the aid of the X ray, or
              Roentgen ray, as it is popularly known.
              How many intelligent and well educated
              men and women know, or knew a month
              ago, what a cathodo is or was?
              Yet the name cathode dates back to the
              time of Faraday, 1833.
              Tho cathodo ray has been known for
              more than 15 years.
              Photography with the cathode ray. is
              more than two years old.
              In view of tho excitement created all

              by scientists in tho last two months, tBasa

              Koentgon was one of the investigators. It

              Crookes, Hittorf and others. For this
              reason Roentgen is a popular horo and
              Lenard is ignored. But the scientific world
              gives Lenard the crodit which is his due,
              and If ho is. not a person of narrow mind
              he is, no doobt, content with that.
              Nikola Tesla, who believes he came very
              near a somewhat similar discovery, smiles
              when he speaks of the public excitement
              over the cathode photography and says ev
              erything will find its place when history is
              written. Mr. Tesla has a large interest
              evon now in the development of the fa
              mous discovery, for the Tesla converter is
              used universally to produce those powerful
              rays with which Roentgen was able to ac
              complish what would have been impossi
              ble to Lenard without the Tesla apparatus.
              In fact, but for Tesla's invention there
              would have been no photographing of the
              bones of tho hand. Lenard never got be
              yond the point of making the rays pene
              trate pieces of metal foil.
              If you have ever been in a scientifio class
              and studied electricity, you know the Ley
              den jar, with its brass knob, from which
              sparks of electricity pass when it is
              brought close to a conductor, provided tho
              jar is charged. This is statio electricity,
              or electricity which can bo produced by
              ordinary friction. It was the first elec
              tricity known. Probably also you remem-

              ber the tube in whioh electricity waa made
              to pass from the positive to the negative
              pole of an interrupted circuit through a
              partial vacuum. The operation was ac
              complished with a brilliant display of col
              ored lights, suggesting a fireworks show in
              miniature. The jar charged with statio
              electricity and the vacuum tube are the
              foundation of the cathode photography.
              Faraday gave the title "anode" to the
              positive pole and "cathode' to the nega
              tive pole.
              Between Hittorf and Crookes lies the
              credit of the discovery that from the cath
              ode as well as from the anode in the
              vacuum tube proceeds a ray. For nearly
              half a century the cathoeadbeen appar-
              ently the receptacle, the anode the produ
              cer and disseminator, of light. In the bril
              liant rays which streamed from the posi
              tive pole the negative pole was thrown
              completely In shadow until Hittorf and
              Croekes almost simultaneously discovered
              that it, too, propagated a ray.
              Crookes Achievements.
              Crookes achievements in the direction
              of producing a vacuum resulted in the
              Crookes tubes which have become famous
              popularly as well as scientifically of late be
              cause of their use in cathode photography.
              It was in one of his vacuum tubes that
              Crookes hunted down the cathode ray, or,
              os a recent scientifio writer puts it, "vital
              ized" the ray for the benefit of the Eoyal
              society and the British association in
              1879. In the scientific world the discovery
              was regarded as of grave importance, and
              the scientific journals made much of it.
              But if there was any mention of it in the
              daily or weekly newspapers it must have
              been very brief, and to the reader of nn
              sciontific mind must have seemed very un
              interesting, for who, by the widest stretch
              of the imagination, could have associated
              tho fact that a ray of some kind, imper
              ceptible to tho eye under ordinary condi
              tions, proceeded from the negative pole of
              a vacuum tube with the possibility of pho
              tographing the human brain? Certainly
              Crookes did not, and it was not until 1891
              that the discovery was made that these
              poculiar rays would penetrate solids. Wie
              demann and Ebcrt noticed in that year
              that gold leaf coatings on vacuum tubes
              were transparent to the cathodo rays.
              This fact, being made known to the sci
              entifio world, was developed by the late
              Professor Hertz, whose assistant was Pro
              fessor Philipp Lenard. Professor Lenard
              became deeply interested in this peculiar
              property of the cathode ray and made ear
              nest efforts to classify the ray, forming a
              theory that it was of etherio nature and
              basing his experiments on that idea. Up
              to the timo of his experiments the rays
              had been studied only in the vacuum.
              The glass of the vacuum tube seemed im
              pervious to thorn. Professor Lenard want
              ed to get them into the air. With othor
              scientifio men, he believed that thoy could
              not be led through glass, and he did not
              know that they would pass into the air,
              but their ability to penetrate metal seemed
              to offer a means of leading them without
              tho tabe. Professor Hertz suggested the

          tion.
          New York, Oct. 20.—1 t is a most dif
          ficult thing to interview Nikola Tesla,
          but to sit down and talk with him, man
          to man, ;ah, that is a different matter,
          and if one has had that privilege he will
          be glad to remember it in years to come,
          and to tell his grand-children about It,
          for it is quite likely that they will know
          very well who Nikola Tesla was.
          This brilliant young electrician, who un
          doubtedly is the foremost thinker of the
          world in his chosen field Is honestly
          and sincerely modest. No writer who
          has tried to get him to talk for publica
          tion has any doubts on that score. “It
          is an embarrassment to me,” he says,
          "that my w-ork has attracted much pub
          lic attention, not only because I believe
          that an earnest man who loves science
          more than all should let his wvork speak
          for him if it will, but because I am afraid
          that some of the scientists whose friend
          ship I value very much suspect me of en
          couraging newspaper notoriety." Mr.
          Tesla reverted to this matter several
          times in the course of two conversations
          \SjEy
          and is evidently sensitive about it. There
          fore, the portionsof this article that come
          from him should be regarded as a spe
          sial concession, particularly as he has
          never talked so freely before. Bogus
          interviews with him have been pub
          lished of late, but this is genuine.
          Mr. Tesla spends his days on the fourth
          floor of a machine shop at No. 33 South
          Fifth avenue. His name does not appear
          anywhere on the building, and there is
          nothing about the place to indicate that
          it is one of the world’s centers of electri
          cal interest. The whole floor is occupied
          by Mr. Tesla’s laboratory, except that one
          corner is partitioned off into the plainest
          of little offices containing principally a
          modest desk for the inventor a more mod
          est desk for his bookkeeper; a book case
          largely devoted to the ’’Official Gazette of
          the patent Office,” and a small black
          board which hangs on the. wall pnd bears
          evidence of hard Usage. The black; is
          worn from this board in several spots,
          and the rest.of it is covered with figures
          and cabalistic signs. No doubt the sci
          ence of electricity would have been no
          tably poorer but for some of the prob
          lems worked out on that shabby black
          board, for when the inventor is puz
          zled he goes to it and works on it nerv
          ously with a stubby piece of chalk.
          The laboratory itself looks common
          place to the uninitiated. It is filled with
          machinery and electrical appliances, arid
          a’stranger prowling about, the building at
          will would surely mistake its fodrth floor
          for a part of the machine shops below.
          One who is not an electrician would find
          in the Tesla workshop none of the mar
          vels that make Edison’s laboratory better
          than a circus for the sight-seer. An elec
          trician. however, would find secrets
          there with which he could make and
          break coliosal fortunes on the stock
          market, for the reasons that will ap
          pear further on.
          -But Mr. Telsa's half-dozen employes
          are tried and trusted men, and the would
          be visitor would find it an extremely dif
          ficult matter to get into this laboratory.
          If he did get In he tvouid be more than
          Ikely to find the Inventor there, working
          over some bit of machinery, with a hand
          kerchief tied about his throat in lieu of
          a collar, yet dressed In clothes of fash
          ionable cut. and generally looking very
          neat and clean. Unlike Mr. Edison, the
          younger inventor has some regard for his
          personal appearance.
          One rarely meets a man more free from
          affectations and self-consciousness than
          Nikola Tesla. He docs not like to talk of
          himself, and when that subject comes up
          ho Is sure to steer away from It as quickly
          He possible. He has bachelor quarters at
          the Gerlach, on West Twenty-seventh
          street, but he can be found at Delmonlco s
          nearly always at breakfast and dinner
          time.
          With due apologies to Mr. Tesla for so
          much personality, It may bo said that h
          has the same cast of countenance us
          Ignarc Jan Paderewski— long and thin,
          with fine, clean-cut features, low fore
          head, and a certain gleam of the eye that
          denotes what might b called spirituality.
          He is an idealist and one Who has created
          n Ideal of him from the fume that he
          ha* won, wHI not disappoints in him
          lP ?n Bteln S him for first time. He
          ai fully 6 f ee t tall, very slender, very dark
          01 complexion, nervous and wiry. Im
          i r-ressionable maidens would fall in love
          with him at sight, but he has no time
          to think of impressionable maidens. Day
          j an d night he is working away at deep
          j problems that fascinate him, and any one
          who talks with him for even a few mln
          i y ntes will get the impression that science
          i 18 his only mistress and that he cares
          more for her than for money or fame.
          Any one who has met Paderewski and
          has been able to speak German or French
          with sufficient fluency to enjoy a con
          i versation with him, and who has also had
          the pleasure of a talk with Tesla across
          j one of Delmonico’s tables, will feel tn
          stinctlvely that the Polish pianist and the
          Servian electrican have much in com
          mon, and that it is- a great pity they
          have i>ever met. Some philanthropist
          could do both of them a service by bring
          ing them together when Paderewski
          comes to this country again next Decem
          ber. They could at least find a common
          ground of interest in Slavic literature,
          j with which both have a wide acquaint
          ance.
          Speaking of love for science, Mr. Tesla
          said the other day in one of the rare mo
          ments when he could be induced to talk
          of himself: “Wherever I am, I cannot
          help working at problems that present
          themselves to me and seem so important
          that I cannot help but try to solve them.
          I spend so many hours at my laboratory
          at times that my friends become alarmed
          and threaten to lock the place- up and
          hide the key. Seriously,” he continued,
          with earnest face and eyes fairly ablaze,
          “seriously, if they tried to do that I
          Ehould shoot them. 1 would indeed. It
          makes no difference to a man’s health how
          long he works as long as loves his
          work, for his affection is like the oil in
          i the lamp which keeps the wick burning
          I without consuming the wick itself. When
          the oil is gone, then it is that the wick
          I goes fast. If at any moment I lost my
          eagerness and enthusiasm, then very
          likely I would go to pieces.
          Nikola Tesla.
          "That was what would have happened
          to me if I had continued to be a journ
          alist. You never knew that I was once a
          member of your profession? Well, I was.
          The trouble with me was that I wrote too
          carefully, and, as it seems to me, too
          thoughtfully. When I wrote an article
          of which I was particularly proud, my
          friends would say: 'Tesla, that was a
          masterpiece! But the editor would sayt
          ‘Why don't you write something more
          lively? Not a half a dozen people would
          read that stuff.’ No, journalism is the
          hardest work in the world for the man
          who wishes to he thoughtful. My heart
          was not in it, and it would have worn
          me out soon, like the wick without any
          oil. Even as it is now 1 get worn out
          sometimes, but it is a great comfort to be
          one’s own master and to feel that there
          is nothing to prevent one’s dropping all
          work at any moment and starting for
          Europe or elsewhere for as long a rest as
          one wants.
          “X have nottced a queer thing about my
          mental operation, and that is that my
          mind seems to work in two halves, each
          independently of the other, so that when I
          talk, or even when I sleep, only one half
          of my mind appears to be thus engaged,
          the other half goes on steadily with what
          ever I have on my mind, or may be I
          ought to say with whatever it has on Its
          mind. My friends say, ‘You will kill your
          self.' X say, ‘Nonesense.’ I used to be an
          athlete once and I recuperate very quickly
          Bee me now.” He held up his hands as if
          they were trustworthy indicators of his
          physical condition. They were long ami
          thin and nervous. They trembled a little
          and the conclusion naturally to be drawn
          from them was that their possessor was a
          man whose tremendous energy, although
          under good control, was likely to use him
          up if run at such high pressure much
          longer.
          Mr. Tesla is only 37 years old, and he
          looks even younger. Ho was horn at a
          town called Sinlijan In Servia, on the bor
          derland of Austro-Ilungary. His family
          was an old one, cultured and highly re
          spected. His father was an eloquent
          preacher of the Greek church, and his
          mother was a woman of re markable In
          genuity. Ho hud an Inherited taste for
          mechanics and it Is her blood that made
          Tesla what he is. His father wanted him
          to enter the church, but he could not be
          kept away from experiments in magnet
          ism and electricity, in which he was
          deeply interested by the time he was ifi.
          Ho was finally permlttd to go to a poly
          trhnle school with the Idea of becoming
          a professor of mathematics and physics.
          He was making inventions of Improve
          ments for the telephone before he was
          35 years old. He secured employment In
          Baris as an electrical engineer and then
          came to America early in the Sb’s, not be
          eause he had any definite employment in
          view, hut because he became convinced
          that the United States was the best coun
          try in the world for an inventor, because
          new Ideas *ere more quickly and highly
          appreciated here than anywhere else
          The day lie arrived here he went to

          join a company organized to sell some of
          his inventions in arc lighting.
          Much of Mr. Tesla’s spare time during
          his first five years in this country was
          devoted to experiment with what is known
          as the rotating field for use with the
          alternative current. In 1887 Prof. An
          thony proved that the young electrician
          had produced an alternating current mo
          tor of an efficiency equal to that of di
          rect current motors, yet dispensing with
          the brushes and commutators which had
          added materially to the cost and incon
          venience of manufacturing electricity.
          He pushed on eagerly in the field he had
          opened, experimenting with alternating
          currents of extraordinary high potentials
          and frequencies. The results of his ex
          periments were laid before the public in a
          lecture delivered before the American
          Institute of Engineers in May, 1891. Before
          that time he had been known only to elec
          tricians. By the hour the reports of that
          lecture had found their way to the public,
          he was famous. The brilliant gathering
          of scientists before whom the lecture
          was delivered, was taken by storm with
          his theories and his remarkable experi
          ments in verification of them. Boon after,
          Those Little Worlds.
          another lecture was delivered before the
          most notable body of electricians m Hu
          ron th Institution of Electrical Engi
          n, and his receptlon by
          them was as enthusiastic as it had been in
          America. A day later, by special request,
          he repeated his experiments before the
          Royal Institution, and soon afterward re
          sponded to an urgent call from the two
          foremost societies of engineers in France.
          In 1593 he delivered lectures in Philadel
          phia and Europe, which served to inten
          sify public. Interest in him. One of his
          experiments on these two occasions was
          spectacular in the extreme. Facing an
          audience of some 5,000 persons, he passed
          through his body a current of 200,000 volts,
          causing streams of light to pour from his
          body and break forth from his finger tips,
          whereas a current of a hundreth part of
          that energy would have killed him in
          stantly, thus proving that the amount of
          electric energy that may be passed into
          the human body depends on the strength
          and frequency of the current, and that the
          higher these are the less harm they do the
          body. Mr. Tesla said that at the time
          that the only inconvenience he felt from
          thus making an electric light of himself
          was a slight pricking as of a needle, and
          a burning sensation at the finger tips.
          The most important work on which
          Mr. Tesla is now engaged, and which bids
          fait to bring him more fame than any
          thing he has done before this, is a machine
          by which a heretofore unheard of steam
          pressure can be applied to the generation
          of electricity, reducing the waste of the
          current, and what is of supreme impor
          tance, reducing the cost of electricity.
          It is easy to see that any device by which
          the cost of electric power is brought be
          low the cost of steam power will bring a
          revolution in the process of manufactur
          ing more sudden and startling than was
          brought about by the introduction of
          steam. The economical transmission of
          electricity generated by water power, as
          at Niagara Falls, has already brought a
          promise of this revolution, and if Mr.
          Tesla’s machine will bring a correspond
          ing reduction in the cost of electricity
          to cities too far away to derive benefit
          from water power like that at Niagara,
          then, indeed, the revolution will be com
          plete. Electric motors will everywhere

          take the place ot costly and wasteful
          shafting In mills and factories, and the
          day when private houses will be lighted,
          heated and, to some extent, run by elec
          tricity, will be brought almost as near to
          other cities as It now is to Buffalo, which
          will receive Its first Installment of power
          from Niagara Palls In a few weeks at a
          price promised to be somewhere near
          a fourth cheaper than that now paid for
          the work done by steam.
          This much may be said positively, and
          the statement is here made to the public
          for the first time: If the wonderful ma
          chine on which Mr. Tesla is now putting
          the finishing touches works as well else
          where as It has already worked in the
          Tesla laboratory, it will bring the extra
          ordinary advantages suggested above.
          The Inventor himself refuses to make any
          definite statement as to what his engine
          will do. "I know," he says, "that It will
          accomplish in my laboratory results that
          cannot but be considered important, and
          that certainly open up anew field for
          high-pressure boilers. It la now in op
          eration and has succeeded absolutely, but
          of course I must not predict from labora
          tory results what a machine will accom
          plish when applied to public uses. It
          may take two or three years to prepare
          for placing it on the market. I have, of
          course, a pretty definite Idea as to the
          reduction it will make In the cost of
          electricity, bwhy It would not be well to give the
          figures.”
          The young inventor endeavors to speak
          very conservatively of this now machine
          of his, but It Is quite probable that he
          believes he has solved one of the most
          Important practical problems within reuch
          of the electrical science of the present
          day. Any one who Is familiar with the
          mathematics of the steam engine will ap
          preciate one phase of his device when
          It is stateei that it is now run with a
          steam pttssure of 3711 pounds, the highest
          that was ever put to practical use The
          p'cssure generally used Is oboi.it 175
          pevnds. The boiler which supplies this
          stium pressure In the Tcslu laboratory
          In said to be the most powerful ever ob
          structed. It was built for the Inventor by
          Babcock A Wilcox, and so far nas re
          sponded to the amazng test to which It
          has teen put. The machine to which this
          unprecedented pressure has been applied
          has to run almost without friction, that
          Is tie kernel of Mr. Tesla's discovery.
          He tells me that he would dare apply s
          steam pressure of 1,000 pounds to his ma
          chine. and would do so If )u> could get a
          boiler that could supply the pressure
          Engineers who read this statement will
          conclude, unless they know Mr. Tesla
          personally, that he is craay.
          One technical value of this new discov
          ery for utilizing steam at high pressure is
          in the saving that it makes in the cost of
          heat for producing the steam, because it
          is a queer freak of nature that requires
          proportionately less heat to produce steam
          at high pressure than to produce it at
          low pressuro. For nstanoe. It takes an
          Increase of only 56 degrees Fahrenheit
          to raise steam- pressure from 125 pounds
          up to 250 pounds.
          There are other electricians who say of
          Mr. Telsa that he is not a particularly
          great man as a prat tlgnl working el
          trician, and that his machines are not al
          ways as valuable in practice as they are
          in theory, but most of them admit will
          ingly that he has no peer as a theorist and
          investigator, a dreamer of the dreams that
          will come true. His talk of the future is
          worth thinking about. He Is very confi
          dent that great things are coming soon
          through the utilization of the electrosta
          tic magnetic condition of the earth Itself.
          "Sometime,” he says, “electricity will be
          taken from all about us and used for light,
          heat and motive power. We will rea -h
          down to the earth and tap the current
          anywhere, getting all we want without ex
          pense. It Is Interesting to sit down some
          where, away from all interruption, and
          think out what that would mean. It
          seems hardly possible that these wonders
          can be far away, because the process by
          which they can be realized is so pimple.
          Expressed roughly, all that would have to
          be done would be to set the earth’s elec
          tricity to vibrating, and adjust a machine
          to these vibrations wherever the force
          was required. It is something as if the
          earth were a rubber bag. Shake It til
          one place and you feel the vibrations In
          another place. You and I could not feel
          the electrical vibrations, but I have in
          mind a machine that will. If nothing else
          is transmitted by these vibrations, intelli
          gence surely will be. I have the best of
          reasons for predicting that messages will
          be transmitted through the earth In this
          way without wires, like a pulse through a
          human being. It seems surprising that
          this has not been done before.
          "It Is reasonable to suppose that the
          eai ill's electricity is generated by the
          atoms of which all things are composed.
          We and our world are not only whirling
          through space with terrific speed, but
          v
          Tho Incondescent Human Lamp.
          every little atom in the world is whirling,
          too. Now there is good reason to believe
          that the molecules and their atoms are
          really little worlds that revolve and move
          in their orbits like tho stars, causing the
          ether about them to spin with them, thus
          generating electricity, or affording the
          conditions suitable to its generation.
          "While electricity could hardly be call"d
          the ether itself, it is probable that the ef
          fects of dynamic electricity and electro
          magnetism are the effects of ether In
          motion, and the effects of static elec
          tricity are the effects of ether under a
          strain. The discovery of a method of
          utilizing this practically exhaustless force
          that lies so close at hand, would uncover
          what are surety' somff of the greatest se
          crets of the 'uAlVefAe. It would be the
          greatest discovery since the creation, and
          would bring about a total revolution In
          all life."
          Mr. Tesla's enthusiasm Is of the kind
          that kindles quickly, and the great elec
          trical work now going on at Niagara Falls
          is one of the subjects that is most likely
          to arouse it. “Some day all wood and coal
          will be used up," he said, when this sub
          ject was introduced, "and so far as I can
          see, we will freeze and starve to death
          unless electricity is used to transmit the
          exhaustless energy of water power to any
          distance, wherever man has his habita
          tion, and turn it into light, heat and power
          for him. But now that transmission of
          energy by means of electricity has be
          come not only possible, but practical, there
          need be no more unpleasant speculations
          about what will happen to us after the
          world's supply of fuel has been exhausted.
          The operations at Niagara are a promise
          •to us of this insurance against what tl.e
          future may have in store for us. The
          work there Is inspiring of confidence, too,
          lor the future of electricity.”
          He believes it is possible to deliver
          electricity generated at the falls to ihe
          doors of New York cheaper than steam
          power is generated here. He was ex
          plicit on this point and had evidently
          given careful thought to the subject at
          some previous time. He said; "If you
          have 150,000 horse-power to transmit in one
          bulk, you can send it 500 miles and yet
          compete with steam generated on the
          spot for the engines now in use. But If
          you send only 10,000, for Instance, then In
          my estimation it cannot be gent to com
          pete with steam to a distance of more
          than 50 miles. It should be added, how
          ever, that while this statement Is true

          A fellow-electrrtan who is in a poslton
          to judge of Mi Tesla with friendly Im
          partiality gives this opinion of him—and
          It Is an opinion that will probably be
          found to have the approval of most of the
          scientists who have come In contact with
          this wonderful young man: ”He is a
          scientist who Is In advance of ills time, a

          Nikola Tesla, at 79, Clears
          Up Old Mystery of
          Earth Shock.
          By United Pren
          NEW YORK, July 11.—Scientist
          Nikola Tesla's birthday revelation
          that he started an earthquake
          alarmed a downtown ghetto today.
          Most Immediate reaction to the
          famous inventor's announcement of
          three “revolutionary discoveries" j
          was startled curiosity about the lo
          cation of his secret laboratory,
          which supposedly still houses his
          earthquake machine.
          Mr. Tesla refused pointedly to
          disclose wh?re he works—the world's
          weirdest spot in popular mind to* j
          day. In addition to the mysterious
          quake maker" he puckishly de-j
          scribed, Mr. Tesla s workshop was j
          revealed as containing also anew
          kmd of motor driven by “cosmic j
          particles” from the sun, and a
          mechanism that sends vibrations
          rippling through the earth as anew
          form of communication.
          The inventor, whose 700 basic I
          patents include widely used meth
          ods of large-scale distribution of
          electricity, assumed on his seventy
          ninth birthday the aspect of a sin
          ister wizard, when he confessed
          that in his bony, wedge-shaped
          head started the Houston earth
          quake of 37 years ago.
          One day violent temblors shook
          a neighborhood. They centered
          mysteriously in one building. Peo
          ple w ere thrown into panic. Fire-)
          men and police responded to alarms.
          Suddenly the vibrations stopped.!
          Mr. Tesla said the quake" ceased l
          when he snatched up a hammer
          nnd knocked a gadget from the wall j
          of his laboratory’. His workshop
          then was in the most affected build-
          ing. Where it is now he refused to
          reveal.

          brations. He said a small quake
          maker could shake a whole city to
          pieces.

          WIRELESS LIGHT NEW FEAT OF SCIENCE WILL BE
          OF GREAT VALUE TO ISO
          LATED PLACES.
          SO SAID NIKOLA TESTA, THE WIZARD
          Wishing rings, magic carpets and
          Aladdin's lamp are but another way of
          saying 'twentieth century" magic.
          When through the darkness of the
          night, there flew swiftly and silently
          the waves of power that set a light
          glowing steadily, and gave no indica
          tion of mortal agency, the mystery
          and magic of the Genie of Wireless
          was once again to be noted.
          When Signor Marconi announced
          the other day that he had succeeded
          in lighting an electric lamp through
          the agency of wireless he opened to
          the imagination the vista of a not far
          distant future when antannae on the
          roofs of houses would draw the forces
          of light from the dark air; when man,
          with nice calculation, might send a
          shaft of light into the blackest corner
          of the earth. What Nikola Tesla said
          21 years ago—that the power of light
          might be sent on the directed wires
          of the air to the nethermost parts of
          the world—seemed to have had its
          first practical substantiation.
          However much the announcement
          of this latest experiment may have
          charmed the lay mind, the scientific
          world received it only with a modicum
          of interest; in fact, the shrug of indif
          ference almost amounted to a shrug of
          scorn. For. though the feat of light
          ing a lamp by wireless over a distance
          of six miles is admitted to be one of
          sentimental interest, the experts of
          the scientific world declare no new
          principle has been established and the
          commercial or practical value of wire
          less lighting is nil and will in all likeli
          hood remain so.
          The criticism of all is based on this
          fact—that it requires too much power
          to make it of general value. While
          Mr. Marconi's transmitter was at
          tached to a 100-horse-power apparatus,
          the light that was generated six miles
          away amounted only Uj/^pproximately
          one-twentieth of one horse-power. And
          if one illuminated a lamp of 10 watts
          at a distance of six miles it would re
          quire a transmitting power of 100 kilo
          watts or 10,000 watts.
          "Nothing in it," was the comment of
          Michael I. Pupin, professor of electro
          mechanics at Columbia university, and
          famous throughout the world for the
          "Pupin coil." "It's a nice experiment,
          but that's all. It has not demonstra
          ted any new principles or modification
          of an old one, and certainly doesn't
          show where it can be of any practical
          worth.
          "Almost all the power generated,
          you see, loses itself in the air. It dissi
          pates itself. Only one-ten-thousandth
          reaches its objective point. Conse
          quently it is anything but probable
          that sufficient energy can ever be gen
          earted to use such a scheme of light
          ing for general purposes or even for
          experimentation over tremendous dis
          tances.
          "Furthermore, while most of the
          waves are lost in the air, thousands of
          other receivers placed anywhere in the
          neighborhood of their route can catch
          and absorb them. As far as its objec
          tive point is concerned it will be 'the
          light that failed,' indeed."
          The criticism of John Stone is along
          similar lines. Mr. Stone, at one time
          a lecturer at the Massachusetts Insti
          tute of Technology, is one of the
          world's greatest authorities on radio
          problems. He has been granted more
          than 121 patents for inventions by the
          United States government.
          "Yes, it is interesting," said Mr.
          Stone slowly. "But I see no hope now
          for its commercial possibilities. The
          great difficulty—rather one of the
          great difficulties—is that only a small
          part of all the power transmitted can
          be picked up. While 100 horse power
          is generated, probably one-twentieth
          of one horse-power is the amount real
          ized for practical purposes.
          "However, the 'wireless lightning,'
          as it may be called, is merely a logical
          development of all the principles that
          we have known for a long while. It is
          nothing new, and it is nothing particu
          larly astonishing. Although I might
          say that my personal opinion is that
          nothing will come of it, it doesn't do
          to prophesy in that fashion; so I will
          say that some day it may develop into
          something."
          Dr. Lee De Forest, whose name has
          been associated with things wireless
          for many years, is much more em
          phatic in his statements.
          "You can't make it strong enough
          for me," he said, "that it is the most
          inefficient method for transmitting
          power that man could possibly devise.
          It has absolutely no commercial sig
          nificance. It is interesting first as an
          experiment and then as an example of
          how far inefficiency can be carried.
          "It has been known for many years
          that wireless waves could light a small
          light, but no one considered it of suf
          ficient importance to prove it, except
          for very short distances. Nikola Tesla
          showed that it was possible years ago.
          We know that we can get 10 watts of
          light over a distance of a few miles,
          but to obtain even so small a quantity
          over 10,000 watts must be radiated.
          Consequently it is obvious that for
          practical purposes wireless lighting is
          quite impossible."
          It was in St. Louis in 1893, in a lec
          ture delivered before the National
          Electric Light association, that Nikola
          Tesla first predicted the transmission
          of messages and power without the
          means of wires. He said at that time,
          in speaking of "the transmission of in
          telllgibl e signals, or perhaps even
          power, to any distance without the
          use of wires, I am becoming daily
          more convinced of the practicability
          of the scheme."
          Tesla, who was known as "the father
          of wireless" 10 years ago, doesn't be
          lieve that Marconi's scheme will ever
          be satisfactory where great distances
          are concerned for general use. But i
          he believes that wireless lighting is
          possible, and that the scheme upon
          which he has been working for years
          will some day make it an accomplished
          fact.
          "Some day," declared Tesla, "we
          will light the nethermost corner of the j
          earth by transmitting the power of
          light on air waves. From my labora-!
          tory in Long Island I will be able to
          light the homes of Australia—in fact,
          to circle the globe with a band of
          light.
          "But my plan is different from Mr.
          Marconi's, necessarily. Most of hiB
          power is dissipated; by my apparatus
          91 per cent of the energy will be con
          served. Naturally, however, wireless
          lighting will be foolish, if not imprac
          tical, for lighting great cities in the
          midst of civilization. It will be valua
          ble mostly for isolated places. Wher
          ever there is a home or a group of
          homes far from civilization, whether
          in the arctic north or in the depth of I
          some vast desert or a lonely island in
          the sea—for such a spot the wireless
          lighting will be both valuable and
          cheap."

          Barnest of New York opposed the bill be
          cause he believed there were gross irregulari
          ties in the adoption of the constitution of
          Wyoming because hebelloved the territory did
          not contain the population requisite and be
          cause there were incorporated in the constitu
          tion features based upon the subject of female
          suffraEO antagonistic to republican institutions
          Carey of Wyoming made a strong plea for
          the admission of the territory He contended
          that its constitution was adopted by the free
          and fair vote of its citizens and its population
          was sufficient Ho defended the provision of
          the constitution extending the right of suflrage
          to women He said that President Harrison
          had endeared himself to the people of Wyoming
          by observing the spirit of the Republican na
          tional platform respecting the appointment of
          territorial residents to territorial offices and
          with more manhood than his predecessor say
          ing no to eastern office seekers Neither politi
          cal party could make a point by obstructing the

          Crocker of Missouri opposed the bill I was
          nothing more nor less than n partisan measure
          designed to perpetuate tho power of the Repub
          lican party It like the Idaho bill should
          be called a bill to add three electoral votes and
          two Senators to the Republican column in 1892
          Oates of Alabama opposed the measure be
          cause it proposed to give women the right to
          vote and made attendance at school com
          pulsary
          Dunncll of Minnesota was inclined to vote
          against the bill on account of the woman suffrage
          clause
          Washington of Tennessee attacked tho
          womans suffrage clause and held the people of
          Wyoming had violated the provision of the act
          of organization limiting the suffrage to white
          male suffrage Women might be sent from

          WOMAN`S CONGRESS 1895
          The second annual session of the
          Woman's Congress of the Pacific Coast
          was called to order in Golden Gate Hall
          yesterday morning at 10:30 o'clock by the
          president, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper of tnis
          City. Before it had concluded its first
          day's labors, the home, the new woman,
          motherhood and child training, and that
          universally interesting subject, marriage,
          were handled vigorously— the latter, in
          several instances, without gloves.
          The beautifully decorated hall was filled
          to overflowing for quite a time before the
          hour announced for the opening. Every
          seat in the auditorium was taken, the gal
          leries were packed and jammed with fair
          women and their escorts, and the aisles be
          low were crowded with many ladies and
          quite a number of men brave men at that
          to venture into such a maze of feminine
          loveliness, wit and wisdom.
          The ladies of the auxiliary had worked
          hard to make the big bare stage look pic
          turesque, and their efforts were crowned
          with complete success. The walls sur
          rounding the platform were covered by
          tall, slender bamboo trees, which were in
          terspersed with a few good prints and en
          gravings. Handsome screens and shaded
          lamps helped to give the stage a drawing
          room effect, which was completed with
          pretty chairs and lounges.
          The president's table was a mass of fra
          grant crimson roses, in the midst of which
          was placed a marble statuette of the fa
          mous Lucretia Mott. Susan ±5. Anthony's
          seat had been made almost as gorgeous as
          a regal throne. It was an antique, high
          backed chair, which the ladies had dsaped
          with old gold plush and wreathed with
          yellow marguerites, tied with orange rib
          bons the suffrage color.
          Flowers were everywhere on the plat
          form. Suspended from the ceiling,
          "Woman's Congress, 1895." could be read
          in large floral letters, and the left side of
          the platform was entirely banked up with
          an immense floral tribute which an anony
          mous friend had sent to the president.
          Ana Susan B. Anthony herself, the
          grand old woman of woman's rights, the
          evangel of the new woman, as new as she
          beamed upon the welcoming faces before
          her as the newest woman of them all.
          White handkerchiefs waved and hands
          clapped at her initial appearance, and her
          utterances throughout the day were em
          phatically punctuated by the warmest
          demonstrations. The Rev. Dr. Anna H.
          Shaw, the first lieutenant of Miss Anthony,
          received her full 6hare of the plaudits of
          the audience. Her utterances were mer
          rily pointed shafts at many things, none
          the lesE telling for their humor, and served
          only to strengthen the impression the peo
          ple had gained of the reverend spinster
          through the prints of the country.
          And the women of California. They, too,
          did themselves and their State proud by
          their efforts on the rostrum. The address
          of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, the president,
          was one of the most beautiful, direct and
          logical ever delivered from any platform
          in San Francisco, barring none. It evoked
          the warmest applause from the visitors
          and fairly took the congress by storm. It
          was epigrammatic and instructive, sound
          and witty, *he extemporaneous interpola
          tions being particularly fetching.

          expect to be newly married, at least.

          VIEWED BY A WOMAN.

          pression of the Con
          gress.
          When I stepped into a Suiter-street car
          Monday morning there was a woman
          seated in the corner opposite me. Her
          hair was a faded, grayish red, her face was
          lined and rather colorless, and her promi
          nent pale blue eyes were tearful and mel
          ancholy. But she was really more mind
          less than miserable, and her sorrowful
          appearance, it seemed to me, was due
          more to weakness than to woe. More
          women entered the car on its way down
          town, a mother with her two daughters, a
          gray-haired woman and others. Their
          faces were just the ordinary, preoccupied
          faces of women who haven't much time or
          wish for thought or action other than the
          duties which are typically feminine.
          At Larkin street a crowd of women came
          in. They were on their way to the
          Women's Congress. You would have
          known it by the important-looking little
          documents they carried, by the fuss and
          flutter of their conversation, by the de
          mure, business-like style of their clothes,
          but most of all by an awakened sexless
          intelligence in their faces and the self-con
          fidence in their brisk movements. The
          women already in the car looked them
          over from toe to bonnet; then their faces
          subsided into indifference and self-absorp
          tion—all but the woman in the corner.
          She seemed fascinated by the new woman.
          She stared at her, she knit her light brows
          feebly, and positively forgot her troubles
          in watching this new kind of female.
          When the car stopped at the corner and
          with a bustling dignity the new woman
          alighted, suddenly the old woman rose too
          in a dazed, uncertain way and followed
          the crowd. She passed into the hall and
          I lost sight of her.
          Women, women All kinds and degrees
          of women. They filled hall and balcony;
          they stood against the walls, and, stand
          ing, filled the aisles. They were enthu
          siastic and hopeful and full of excitement.
          "I do hope they'll begin on time. Women
          never do, you know," said an excitable,
          well-dressed young matron.
          "Perhaps they're waiting for some man.
          A man's name is first on the programme
          or rather program," chuckled a bright-

          faced woman with short dark hair streaked
          with gray.
          The other smiled appreciatively, then
          she said, "Well, you know, punctuality
          isn't one of woman's virtues."
          "I don't know about that," said the
          other stoutly. "I'm always on time and
          so are you."
          "Yes, but we both were business women.
          Besides, you know, men make such fun of
          us about that."
          The short-haired woman sniffed rather
          scornfully.
          "This morning," she said, "coming over
          on the boat there was just the homeliest
          woman I ever saw. A regular fright. John
          said, 'I bet she's going to the Woman's
          Congress. 1 'I bet a nickel she isn't.' I said-
          THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 21, 1895.
          So we watched her, and when she got off
          at Kearny street I collected my bet. But
          I got more than a nickel's worth of satis- i
          faction out of it."
          There was triumph in every woman's
          eye when half-past ten arrived, and with
          it the president and principal members of
          the congress. So much for man's accepted
          ideas of woman. But although there is a
          tendency in some of the speakers to at
          tribute all the ills that flesh and morals
          are heir to to the political slavery of
          women, I heard nothing at all of "tyrant
          man." On the contrary, a gentle, forbear
          ing patience was manifest in most of the
          allusions to him. He is unhappily in the
          wrong, but that is his misfortune, not his
          fault, and with time and feminine reme
          dies they hope to enlighten and ultimately
          to convert him. I discovered, too, that al
          though the new woman insists upon shar
          ing man's political and business life, she
          intends that he shall be compensated by
          increased responsibility as husband and
          father.
          "Every mother owes it to her child that
          he be well-born," read an essayist yester
          day.
          "And so does every father," she added
          in one of those significant asides, which
          characterize women's speeches.
          But the most striking thing about this
          woman's convention is the spirit of com
          raderie it fosters. At Golden Gate Hall
          women are actually so interested in things
          that they put aside forms. Introductions
          are unnecessary. If you can tell your
          neighbor that that shy, sunburned, dark
          haired girl is Beatrice Harraden that this
          woman with the intellectual oval face is
          Charlotte Perkins Stetson, that that one
          who wears her hair in a gray mane down
          her back is Laura de Force Gordon that
          the bust is of Lucretia Mott; if you know
          which is Susan B. Anthony and the Eev.
          Anna Shaw; if you know who is the
          woman in the swell gown and the one that
          looks like a guy, the woman next to you
          will not hesitate to make use of you. I
          saw a young woman rise and offer her
          chair in a very gentlemanly manner to an
          older woman she did not know, saying
          simply, "I should have liked to give you a
          seat before, but the crowd is 8O great I
          couldn't get out."
          These congress women seem to have lost
          some feminine vices and gained some mas
          culine virtues. Their self-possession is not
          the assertive arrogance of small-minded,
          notoriety-seeking females. Their convic-
          tion is tempered with dignity and charity.
          Tney are not shrewish, and they deliver
          their message in a frank, good-natured
          way. They have learned how to disagree
          without quarreling, and they are willing
          to admit that there are two sides to a ques
          tion and an infinite number of points of
          view. I don't know that this makes them
          more admirable to men, but it makes
          them more women's women. The audi
          ence yesterday certainly showed great en
          thusiasm they indulged in that feminine
          kind of applause known astheChautauqua
          salute, and the speakers were quite old
          womanly in their allusions to "Dear Aunt
          Susan," "Saint Susan B. Anthony," "That
          martyr, Lucretia Mott," and "Our dear
          Elizabeth Cady Stanton." But there is an
          accent of sincerity and evidence of un
          usual friendship among women in the ac
          counts of those old days "when our ideas
          were not received with applause, nor our
          selves overwhelmed with flowers," as Miss
          Anthony gently expresses it.
          The congress woman is evidently deeply
          religious. "Orthodox of the orthodox,"
          said Rey. Anna Shaw. Miss Shaw tells a
          story well. She is the most manly, not
          mannisn, woman in the congress. Her
          voice is deep and full. She speaks clearly
          and can be heard all over the hall. She
          tells with a chuckle of Miss Anthony's
          wish to impress an Eastern audience with
          the propriety of their religious views, and
          of the unfortunate figure of speech she
          used- when she introduced Miss Shaw as
          her "right bower." "But," gleefully adds
          the Rev. Anna Shaw, "every man in that
          orthodox community knew what a right
          bower is."
          "The religion," said Mrs. Cooper in her
          opening address, "which is all for the next
          world and none for this, is good for
          neither."
          "Amen to that!" came in hysterical,
          quavering tones from the back part of the
          hall.
          Everybody turned around. It was the
          Old Woman with the faded red hair, who
          had sat in the corner of the car. Her pale
          eyes were bright with excitement, there
          were two red spots on her high cheek
          bones, and her hat was a little awry. But
          she was quite unconscious of people's at
          tention. The chair upon which she sat
          had been to her a penitent's bench, she
          had suddenly come to a realization of new
          womanhood, and when the next speaker
          said in tones of conviction: "The new
          woman has come to stay," another heart
          felt "Amen!" from theback of the hall
          attested the Old Woman's conversion.

          THE MORNING SESSION.
          Miss Susan B. Anthony and Rev.
          Anna Shaw Receive
          Ovations.
          The opening session of tbe congress was
          brought to order rather informally by the
          appearance on the stage about 10:30 o'clock
          of the president, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,
          leading the way for Miss Susan B. Anthony
          and the Rev. Dr. Anna H. Shaw. No
          sooner did the vast audience catch sight of
          these ladies than it broke out into the
          wildest kind of applause, most of the ladies
          rising to their feet and waving their hand
          kerchiefs in salute. The pioneer in the
          movement for female suffrage, spectacled
          and white-haired as she was, was bright
          eyed ana active, and as she took the deco
          rated seat set apart for her she beamed on
          the happy faces before her.
          Mrs. Cooper wasted no time in the pre
          liminaries, and as the afficers of the con
          gress took their seats on the platform she
          rapped for order.
          "Friends and co-workers," sne said, "I
          see before me a great many faces that
          greeted us a year ago, and we welcome
          you, thrice welcome you, this morning.
          'The blessing of God maketh rich, and it
          hath no sorrow. 1 And we are to have the
          j invocation for his presence and his blessing
          by the Rev. Dr. Brown."
          The eloquent pastor of the First Congre
          gational Church delivered a solemn prayer
          for the right guidance of the convention,
          the audience listening reverentially and
          attentively till the final amen.
          "His Excellency the Governor," said
          Mrs. Cooper again, addressing the con
          gress, "is, no doubt, attending the funeral
          services of our venerated first Governor,
          Peter H. Burnett. Hence, we shall be
          disappointed in not having the welcome
          of his Excellency. But we shall not be
          disappointed in having the welcome of tne
          Hon. Mayor Sutro. I introduce to you
          Mayor Sutro."
          There was more applause as the
          monarch of the cliffs rose and bowed to
          the storm ol greeting. He said
          Ladies: The pleasant duty and honor de-
          TuJ? H2 on me to welcome you to the City of
          the Golden Gate— an honor in this case doubly
          appreciated, as I see assembled in this hall
          women from different parts of the United
          States who have spent their lives in devotion
          to the betterment of the human family.
          The aristocracy of European countries dates
          back to the dark ages, when Kings and Queens
          often made noblemen of free lances who had
          shown the greatest prowess and skill in war
          if or the P ur P°se of utilizing their talent to
          add strength and support to the throne.
          Here in America we have allowed to be
          reared an aristocracy of money our railway
          magnates, men who have accumulated enor
          mous fortunes by chicanery and oppression,
          and by evil means corrupted our Government,
          which is now domineered over by great cor
          porations.
          We ought to strive and develop in this coun
          try a different kind of aristocracy, that of
          the brain, of worth, of Intelligence and of ad
          vancement.
          If we take that standard we shall find gath
          ered in this hall a higher aristocracy than ever
          assembled in any hall in the king-ridden coun
          tries of Europe.
          The participation of women (the mothers of
          our coming generations ot men) in the selec
          tion of those who are to govern the country
          will elevate the Nation and give a higher
          standard to political affairs.
          AVomen are endowed by nature with a finer
          quality of brain power they have a sort of in
          tuitive knowledge of character and are gener
          ally correct in their judgment.
          I believe in evolution; I think It a part of
          evolution that women, who thus far, in the
          history of the world, have been denied a share
          in the affairs of government, should be per
          mitted to cast their ballots in favor of a puri
          fied and improved administration which will
          cause us to rise higher and higher in civillza-
          Nothing could well be worse than our pres
          ent status; political bosses, corruptly hand
          ling the money-sacks of corporations, rule and
          debase our great country.
          Let noble women step in and restore the
          honesty, simplicity and patriotism of the revo
          lutionary fathers and all will be well.
          I see in this hall one woman (Miss Anthony)
          whom more than a quarter of a century ago I
          have seen, year after year, struggling with
          Senators and Representatives at Washington
          to obtain the political rights of women, and
          who has persistently since and continuously
          fought the battle of freedom, and I wish espe
          cially to do her honor and welcome her and
          welcome you all, and hope that you will carry
          to your homes kind and lasting recollections
          of your assembly in this Cty by the Golden
          Gate.
          "I have the very great honor, now," said
          Mrs. Cqoper, stepping to the front of the
          platform and grasping the hand of Miss
          Anthony, "of introducing to this large
          assemblage one who I believe has done more
          to lift up womanhood, to lift up humanity,
          than any other living woman. This
          I firmly believe. I have the pleasure of in
          troducing Miss Susan B. Anthony, who
          will respond to the Mayor's address of wel
          come."
          Loud handclappings almost drowned the
          last words of the president, and as Miss
          Anthony advanced the vast audience arose
          as one person and wildly waved handker
          chiefs in the Chautauqua salute to the
          white-haired grand old woman of the rights
          of woman.
          "Mrs. President, Mr. Mayor and friends,"
          said Miss Anthony, as soon as the wave
          of enthusiasm had passed, "it is but a few
          minutes over twenty-four hours since my
          friend, Miss Shaw, and myself stepped foot
          on California soil, and this is the third
          vast congregation of your California peo
          ple which we have met— the third vast
          audience and the welcome which your
          Mayor has extended, the welcome which
          these vast assemblages of the men and
          women of your City and your Brooklyn
          across the water— for while lam here I
          can only think of New York and Brooklyn
          to be compared with Ran Francisco and
          Oakland— do not fail of appreciation from
          me. Certainly any heart that could fail to
          appreciate such an ovation— such a recog
          nition—would be wanting in the common
          est elements of human nature.
          "lam grateful for this welcome, not
          from any personal consideration. While
          that is flattering enough, I can assure you
          I take it for the cause for which you make
          the recognition. lam no better looking;
          I, personally, have no more brain, nor
          more power of statement than I had forty
          years ago and, forty years ago, whenever
          my friends, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
          the venerated and sainted Lucretia Mott,
          whenever any of us went into a commun
          ity, the whole community did not take off
          their hats in reverent recognition of our
          coming, but, on the other hand, it was
          with hootings and with jeers and with
          words that were not complimentary they
          met us.
          "It is because the world is coming, not
          to admire the exterior of Lucretia Mott,
          the exterior of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, or
          any of the advocates of this great move
          ment that this ovation comes. It is be
          cause the idea which these women pro
          mulgated almost half a century ago has
          become acceptable to the people, and not
          only acceptable, but it has become the
          cornerstone of the faith in our republic, of
          the faith in our Christianity and of the
          faith in our country altogether. There
          fore, whatever of courtesy, whatever of
          congratulation you offer to my friend, Miss
          Shaw and myself, who have come across
          the mountains and the plains in order to
          look you in your faces in the great con
          gregation whatever you tender to us,
          seemingly personal, she and I and all
          of the friends who are not able to be here
          to-day-^-Mrs. Stanton, the one survivor of
          the women who called the first conventiou
          that was ever held of women in 1848, she,
          sitting in her little room in her little home
          in the city of New York, will feel to-day
          this ovation, this congratulation, this ora
          tion, quite as much as we who are here.
          And everywhere where woman has awak
          ened to her new destiny, to her new hope,
          to her new realization, everywhere where
          woman has thus awakened all over the
          face of this globe, will go the Associated
          Press dispatches of this tender of recogni
          tion and respect and reverence for the
          women who first promolgated this grand
          idea of perfect equality of rights, civil,
          religious, social, literary, educational, for
          the women of the world."
          Loud hand-clappings interrupted the
          flow of eloquence from the lips of Miss
          Antnony, and the waving handkerchiefs
          in the crowded seats, the packed aisles and
          the jammed galleries, looked like myriad
          mammoth flakes of purest snow falling
          from the canopy above.
          "I am glad to be here," resumed Miss
          Anthony, smiling at the smiling audience
          before her. "You will remember, some of
          you who are old enough to remember, that
          this is not my first visit to your coast. It
          will be twenty-four years ago, when the
          11th day of June shall have come, since
          Mrs. Stanton and myself first arrived in
          your City.
          "We are not without recognition then;
          we were not without a most cordial recep
          tion then, but it was not by the multitude
          as it is now. It was the few. I remember
          that when Mrs. Stanton appeared before
          the vast audience, Mr. Stanford, the then
          Governor of the State, made the formal ad
          dress of welcome and presided at the meet
          ing, and Mis. Stanford and himself ten
          dered every possible compliment to us as
          their guests at the Grand Hotel, which
          was then new and magnificent.
          "We have had grand California repre
          sentatives in the East from the beginning.
          As I began wending my way back by the
          railroad on that trip, having just finished
          speaking at Virginia City and gone down
          to Reno to take the train, I found there
          was not a single berth to be had. All were
          taken. Your men had then elected as
          Senator of the United States, the Hon. A.
          A. Sargent. He and his family were then
          on board that train, and, very kindly, the
          two daughters of Senator Sargent shared
          their stateroom with me, and I found"
          resting place and became thoroughly ac

          "Now, I will say again that I am glad to
          be here, and I expect to get a good deal
          more good out of this council of the women
          of the Pacific Slope than it is possible for
          you to get from nay being here with you."
          Aerain the hall rang with applause and
          the flower-scented air was agitated by the
          waving of spotless handkerchiefs as the
          honored pioneer who bad blazed the path
          for the new woman, bowing to the right
          and left, took her seat.
          "There has been a call from the audi
          ence," said Mrs. Cooper, advancing as the
          applause subsided, "for one who captured
          both Oakland and San Francisco yester
          day. 1 have the honor of introducing the
          Rev. Anna Shaw."
          "I want to say to Mrs. Copper and to
          this audience," exclaimed Miss Anthony,
          rising before Miss Shaw had time to step
          forward, "that Miss Anna Shaw is my
          first lieutenant, and she is not only my
          first lieutenant, but is the first lieutenant
          of the great National Woman's Council of
          the United States. She is vice-president
          at large. She comes to you representing
          that body, which is composed of twenty
          of the different National organizations
          of women of this country, representing
          twenty different purposes of the women
          who have been organized, and I hope be
          fore this Pacific Council shall adjourn you
          will vote yourselves members of that great
          National organization of the women of
          the United States."
          More applause, and Mrs. Cooper again
          introduced Miss Shaw, who came forward
          smiling at the white greeting of waving
          handkerchiefs.
          '•My friends," she began, "ycu make me
          feel bashful, because I come with Susan to
          hold her bonnet, and it is honor enough
          for any young woman to hold the bonnet
          of Susan B. Anthony. But as you have
          called me here, I am almost tempted to tell
          a joke on her. Some time since, they toll
          the women in this movement that the
          were out of their sphere. Finding that
          this did not scare us, they said we were
          strong-minded. Well, I would rather be
          strong-minded than have no mind at all.
          Then, when none of these things seemed
          to have any effect on us, they called us a
          lot of infidels, and that nearly scared us to
          death. Here's where the joke comes in.
          "One night in introducing me to a con
          gregation in a large church Miss An
          thony wanted to impress upon her
          hearers that I at least was not an infidel.
          'This is the Rev. Anna Shaw,' she said, 'an
          orthodox minister. She is orthodox of
          the orthodox, and she is my right bower.'
          "Now just think of the "impression on
          that congregation," resumed Miss Shaw,
          when the laughter at her joke had ceased
          echoing. "And the interesting thing
          about it was that every orthodox person
          in the congregation knew what a right
          bower was.
          "Gentlemen and ladies, I certainly thank
          yon on behalf of the Women's Council,
          which lam representing here and I thank
          you on behalf of Miss Anthony, myself
          and the other ladies who have gathered
          from various parts of the country to bu
          present at this congress. I thank you o:i
          behalf of womanhood, because I think this
          congress means better conditions for the
          home and, if for the home, then for the
          whole world. President Eliot of Harvard
          says the home is the sap-root of the state,
          and if that be bo, whatever tends to uplift
          the state uplifts the home. There can be
          no perfect state without a perfect home
          and there can be no perfect state, if the
          home is the sap-root of the state, without
          direct connection between the sap-root and
          the state.
          "If you sever from the life of the state
          one-half of the tap-root you sever one-hali
          of the power and vital energies of the
          state. That for which Miss Anthony and
          Mrs. Stanton stand is the direct connec
          tion between the tap-root and the state,
          and we have come to see this great prin
          ciple accepted all over our country by the
          wisest and best people. We thank you for
          your welcome to our ideas and to our
          principles and, in the name of the
          Women's Council, which I hope to speak
          of hereafter, I thank you for this kindly
          welcome."
          "I now take pleasure," said the presi
          dent, "in introducing to you Mrs. Caroline
          M. Severance of Los Angeles, one of the
          earliest of those women who stood for suf
          frage, and, not only that, but the first
          president of the New England Women's
          Club; 1 and if I were to tell all that Mrs.
          Severance has done for the Pacific Coast I
          should rob her of a good portion of her
          time. It is my great pleasure and honor
          to introduce to you, therefore, Mrs. Caro
          line M. Severance of Los Angeles."
          There was more waving of nandkerchiefs
          as Severance took her stand to the
          left of the president, at the rear of the
          magnificent floral arch. Her voice trem
          bled with emotion as she responded to the
          reception and she was visibly affected. She
          said she had neither strength nor voice
          enough to tell bow grateful she was. Her
          heart and her effort had always been with
          the work at present in hand and her in
          terest had never flagged since 1848. J
          "Susan can tell, she concluded. "We
          have been co-workers in a way."
          "Yes," said Miss Anthony, once more
          rising, "let me tell you about Mrs. Sever
          ance. Just forty-two years ago, in the
          beautiful month of October, the third, or
          fourth, or fifth meeting of the woman's
          rights convention— we talked about the
          woman's right to earn an honest living
          and to get an education— just forty-two
          years ago next October such a convention
          was held in the city of Cleveland. I was a
          guest of this dear woman at that time,
          Lucy Stone, Antoinette Brown, dear
          Lucretia Mott and Fannie Gage, as we
          called her, Ernestine Rose of New York a
          Polish woman who said such beautiful
          things in broken English. I think we
          were nearly all the guests of Mrs. Sever
          ance. I remember that beautiful home of
          hers out on Euclid avenue— a palace where
          we used to love to assemble.
          o "Ah, how different it was then, Mrs.
          Severance," said Miss Anthony, turnine to
          her old friend. "How different it was.
          Instead of having a preacher to come and
          pray for us, we actually had one take Mr
          Garrison by the nose. Yes, Mrs. Sever
          ance has been with us from the begin
          ning."
          The Rev. Ada C. Bowles of Pomona
          added her tribute to the work and worth
          of Mrs. Severance, and called upon the
          audience to give her the Chautauqua
          salute, which was done with a will. The
          president then introduced to the audience
          the following ladies, who made short ad
          dresses appropriate to the occasion: Mrs.
          John F. Swift, president of the Century
          Club of San Francisco; Mrs. I. Lowenbe'rg,
          president of the Laurel Hall and Philo
          math clubs; Miss Mary C. Smith of the
          Ladies' Literary Society of Santa Maria;
          Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eyster of the
          Women's Press Association of the Pacific
          Coast; Mrs. Eliza Orr, corresponding sec
          retary of the Women's Council of Califor
          nia, and Mrs. H. E. Brown of the State W.
          C T. XJ
          Mrs. Ada Van Pelt then took the chair
          and introduced to the audience the presi
          dent, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who was
          greeted with much applause and the sight
          of many fluttering handkerchiefs. She de
          livered the following address:
          Representative Women of the Nation and of the
          Pacific Coast— Honored Friends: I thank Yon
          for your cordial greeting. Ab president of the

          woman In the United States to go to Con
          gress. Miss Uelle Fllgclman, of Helena, Mont.,
          herself a staunch worker In the cause ot
          women and suffrage, tells mo that Miss
          ltankln Is a "wonder woman," a woman
          who with amazing energy has given of
          herself and her money nnd her tlmo for
          tho cause ot womankind, and that now
          when women of Montana have the chance
          to reward her, they have grasped It to
          pay homngo where they feel It is due.
          'Tractlcolly every nonpartisan club of
          women In tho State, tho women of every
          political faith, laying aside party lines have
          unequivocally como out and stumped the
          State for Miss ltankln." Miss Fllgclman
          tells me, "for woman' of Montana say as
          they cast their ballots, '"If It weren't for
          Jcanctto ltankln, I couldn't be voting nt
          nil To Jennctte ltankln more than to any
          other one womnn In Montnmt Is due the
          credit of winning tho right of suffrngo for
          Montana women. You see bho was In
          charge nf the suffrngo campaign which
          swept Montana two years ago, and which
          resulted In a victory at tho first referendum
          over held upon tho question In our State."
          In referring to the personal side of Miss,
          ltankln, Miss Fligclinnn says: "Sho Is a
          keen thinker, a tremendous worker, and
          she has a thorough knowledge of work
          In Congress, gained through her experience
          an a suffrage lobblcst In two hesslons nf
          Congress nnd In tho Legislatures of New
          York. New Hampshire, Delawnre, Florida,
          North Dakota and Montana. Sho Is prob
          ably moio familiar with governmental ma
          chinery than nre many of tho gentlemen
          who already conBtltulo tho cog-t of the ma
          chinery. She Is also entirely familiar with
          social and economic conditions, having stud
          led and traveled extensively throughout the
          United States. Sho knows Montana's needs
          too. for sho has campaigned In every
          county In the Stnto. Then, too, she will
          have an opportunity to work, for tho cause
          of Prohibition In Congress nnd for the In
          terests of the children, and she will also
          work directly In Congress for the Federal
          amendment.
          "We women of Montana feel, too, that It
          will be the most eloquent argument which
          could be put to the eastern Congressmen,
          who have hitherto Ignored tho demand for
          national suffrage made by the enfranchised
          women of the United States, to have a
          woman In Congress."
          CHILD LABOH HOBBY
          Miss ltankln makes a special point of
          the congressional work which Is needed
          for the little children of the nation. She
          dovetails her political plank of suffrago
          with that of decent legislation for children
          and national prohibition.
          'Several years ago during one session of
          Congress," says Miss Rankin In talking of
          the need of somo one to represent the little
          children In Congress. "J300.000 was appro

          a New Food Flavor
          STAHCIinS In some form potatoes or
          rice or bread nre present In good quan
          tity In every well-balanced meal. When nil
          the usual changes have been rung on tho
          serving of potatoes or tho other starches,
          and baking, boiling, frying nnd creaming
          have begun to pall a llttlo, try somo un
          usual wnys of serving the starches to
          tempt nppetltlcs anew. It Is said that de
          llclous French cooking Is mostly sauce, and
          how often do we find burled under a most
          appetizing sauce nnd weighty French name
          a -very homely vegetable or a rather cheap
          cut of meat.
          Most sauces have as their basis a "white"
          sauce or "brown" sauce. Tlio whlto sauce
          Is so called because, whllo flour Is mixed
          In tho saucepan with butter juBt as In the
          case of the brown sauce, tho flour Is not
          permitted to brown. The brown sauce is
          mado by cooking butter end flour together
          until tho flour Is browned. It Is necessary
          to stir the mixture constantly to prevent
          burning, Gravy or stock, one cupful for
          each tnblespoonful of flour and butter used,
          Is ndded.
          A delicious sauce to bo added to boiled
          rice or diced potatoes Is made as follows:
          Six peeled, chopped potatoes, two chopped
          green peppers, four chopped onions, one
          tablosponful of salt, two cupfuls of vinegar.
          These Ingredients nre cooked together
          until soft, which will probably take two
          nnd one-half to tlitfe hours. .Then remove
          from tho stove "Snd strain thoroughly
          through a colander.
          Another tart sauce that makes starchy
          foods moro palatable 1b n Spanish sauce
          which Is made as follows:
          Tvv.ii tablcspoonfuls of melted butter, three
          tablespoonfuls of flour, ono tnblespoonful of
          chopped ham, one tnblespoonful of chopped
          celery, one tablespoonful of chopped onion,
          one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, two
          cupfuls of meat stock or hot water, one
          quarter tcaBpoonful of salt, one-half tea
          spoonful of paprika, two cloves, ono bay
          leaf, one mace.
          The ham and vegetables are cooked until
          brown with the flour and butter mixture,
          salt and paprika. Then other Ingredients
          nre added and cooked slowly for about two
          hours, when they are pressed through the
          colander, and can bo poured over the molded
          rice. If there Is any sauce loft over It can
          be poured over a luncheon dish ot poached
          eggs on toast points.
          A quickly made sauce that Is excellent
          for hot broiled or fried fish and oven for
          chops Is made by mixing together the following:
          One tablespoonful ot butter, one-half
          tablespoonful of Juice ot lemon, -one-half
          tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one-halt
          tablespontul of sojt, dash of pepper.
          These Ingredients are mixed together
          thoroughly (cold) and the finished mixture
          spread on top of the fish or meat with which
          It Is to be served.

          WASHINGTON. Nov 12
          The forty-one women arrested last Satur
          day afternoon for picketing the White
          House In behalf of suffrage were found
          guilty In police court this afternoon. Judge
          Mullowncy did not sentence thft'wpmen. but
          took the case under advisement and said he
          would give It "deep consideration" before
          making the sentences known.
          Three women from Philadelphia Mrs.
          Lawrence Lewis, Miss Kllznheth McShano
          and Miss Cntharlne Lincoln were nrnong
          those found guilty.
          Attorneys for .Mrs. Harvey Wiley, wife
          of the pure food specialist, gave notice of nn
          appeal nnd she ws released tinder $100
          bond. The others, among wheni are Mr?.
          John Winters Ilrannan. social leader or New
          York, and Mrs. William Kent, wife of tin
          former California Congressman, were re
          leased under the $1025 collateral put up by
          Miss Mary Ingham, 'if Philadelphia when
          they were arrested Saturday.
          The suffragists were arraigned In Court
          In groups of fours, sixes nnd eights. Just
          as they marched In different croups to the
          White Houlie Saturday, nnd lifter each
          group wbh tried and found guilty they were
          asked by Judge Mullowney to step aside
          until nil forty-one had been tried, when lie
          said he would pronounce sentence
          Hy hie careful questioning of each of the
          prisoners ns to whether they had been nr
          rested and sentenced heforo for n similar
          orfense, It was plain that Judgo Mullowney
          Intended to give "repeaters" n sentence of
          perhaps six months and first-offenders only
          thirty days In Jail.
          Court opened promptly at nine, but It
          was eleven o'clock before tlie casea of the
          Suffragists wero reached on the ilocketi.
          During the long wait the prisoners nnd
          their friends who crowded tlie court
          amused themselves exchanging newspaper
          clippings nbout their arrest, knitting socks
          and sweaters and discussing the recent suf
          frage victory In New York.
          Many of the prisoners brought suitcases,
          handbags and bundles containing toilet
          articles, clean underclothing arid other
          articles which they Intended taking to Jail,
          as all were determined not to pay fines
          DOCTOR WIL.HY AIDS HIS W1FI0
          Dr Harvey Wiley, of "pure food" fume,
          was In court with Mrs. Wiley, who was
          among the plcketers, and took a seat along
          side his wife nn the front bench. With
          iilm was Ravinond H. Dickey, a Washing
          ton l.iwjer. who had been ictalind ns
          counsel for Mrs. Wiley
          Police Sergeant Lee, in charge of the de
          tail which made the arrests, wan the first
          witness for the Oovernment. Ho raid tho
          forty-one suffragists, bearing their ban
          ners, came to the White House In eight
          croups at 4:30 o'clock Saturday afternoon
          at a time when the Oovernment depart
          ments were letting out. Hy stopping at
          the west gate of the White. House they Imd
          drawn n tremendous crowd, which ob
          structed the sidewalks
          He had told eaci. of the pickets that they
          were violating the law, lie said, and dl
          reeled them to move on. Only one of tho
          forty-one maae any respnurw, mm iicii
          they declined to move they were arrested
          and taken In patrol wagons tn the station
          house.
          The one picket who made response, he
          Bald, replied:
          "I cannot move until I get directions
          from our leader."
          The suffragists called witnesses who said
          tint crowd was not dense; and that it had
          formed because the news had been spread
          broadcast that the pickets would be ar
          rested when thev appeared, rather than be.
          cause the pickets wero there. Pickets had
          stood at the White House gates for six
          months and nobody paid attention to them,
          tho witnesses said, until It was announced
          they would be arrested, when great crowds
          gathered.
          Mrs John Winters Ilrannan. of New
          York, who was In the first group arraigned,
          made a scathing address to the Court when
          Judge Mullowney asked If any of the
          women wlsh-d to say anything before sen
          tence was pronounced.
          HOLD." PRKSIDHNT RKSPONSI1ILK
          "We will hold the President responsible
          for this whole thing, because he will not
          urge tho passage of equal suffrage leglsln
          tlou fer us," shouted Mrs. Ilrannan.
          "Your courts, your policemen, your Jails,
          cannot stop us in this effort to obtain equal
          suffrage. Whatever the verdict or this
          Cnuri may be we shall go on picketing, we
          sb-ill nlcket again at once and keep it up
          The responsibility for thin thing will rest
          upon y mi and not uihiii us."
          This aroused the Ire of Judge Mullowney.
          M, handed out a vitriolic rebuke for what
          be declared their wanton and willful breach
          of the laws of the country
          "Do you think It is the duty of the police
          to make the crowd move on and leave you
          women standing there with your
          he asked. "I'vo tried to explain to ou In
          vour various trlalB ncre inai j"

          Judge Mullowney If she had anything to,
          say.
          "I come from Utah, where I have lieen
          a political worker for tlfb Democratic
          party. I rare here to help In this cause,
          and now I wnt to know why the Demo
          cratic parly had me arrested."
          This question convulsed the courtroom In
          laughter and the ballirts rapped and shouted
          for order.
          Judge Mullowney nlso bent nlmot double
          with laughter. When he recovered hla Ju
          diction composure he said:
          "I'm sure I don't know, madam you'll
          have to risk somebody else."
          When the group was called, which Mrs.
          Wiley was a member. Lawyer Dickey said
          he would represent Mrs. Wiley, but wanted
          to explain carefully that he was not repre.
          sentlng the other women.
          He asked for n separate Jury trial for
          his client, but this wis denied by the
          court on tho ground that the Rlatutes do
          not allow a trial hy Jury In a breach of

          The full grivlty of the present situation
          In West Philadelphia became apparent
          when, of tho seventeen large firms re-pre-rented,
          thirteen were found without a

          "Philadelphia Is not receiving n sriuare

          Women Have Right to Vote
          Tennessee's Ratification
          Gives 9,500,000 More
          Right to Vote for Next
          President in the Fall
          Fight Begun in 1848
          Campaign Opened in Seneca
          Falls Started Movement
          Which Enveloped World
          Woman suffrage was won for the
          women of all the states in the Union
          when Tennessee, th'e thirty-sixth state,
          ratified the Federal amendment. Ap?
          proximately 27,000,000 women will be
          entitled to vote in the Presidential
          election this fall. State suffrage al?
          ready ha^l enfranchised 17.500,000, and
          ratification adds to this number 9,500,
          000.
          Thii marks the end of the women's
          campaign for the ballot which began
          obscurely in a little meeting in Seneca
          Falls, N. Y., in 1848, swept across this
          country, and extendea the political
          freedom of women to nearly every
          other nation in the civilized world.
          Fifteen states in the United States
          already had conferred full franchise
          rights on women, and in fifteen others
          women were entitled to vote for Presi?
          dent and for certain municipal offices,
          but not for members of Congress.
          The suffrage amendment resolution
          was passed by the Congress on June 4,
          19li). Its wording was that of the orig?
          inal Susan B. Anthony amendments,
          drawn up by the pioneer suffragist soon
          after the Civil War had enfranchised
          the colored people and following the
          form of the Fifteenth Amendment. It
          reads:
          "The right of citizens of the United
          States to vote shall not be denied or
          abridged by the United States or by
          any state' on account of sex.
          "Congress shall have power by ap?
          propriate legislation to enforce the
          provisions of this article."

          Special Sessions Called
          The fact that many state legislatures
          did not hold regular sessions in 1920,
          and would be required to call special
          sessions if the .suffrage amendment
          were to become effective in time f?ir
          the Presidential elections, was the last
          great obstacle the suffrage movement
          had to overcome. Even in states
          where the women had voted for I
          many years and where ratification was
          more or less an accepted fact the Gov?
          ernors hesitated to call special ses-
          sions, for reasons of economy, or be?
          cause of local political issues which
          threatened to become embarrassing.
          Governor Allen of Kansas came, to the
          Colby Agrees
          To Speed Final
          ?Suffrage Step
          Secretary of State Will

          Busts To Be Placed in
          Capitol at Washington
          WASHINGTON, Aug. 18. Prompt;
          promulgation of the Federal woman
          suffrage amendment, should the action
          of the Tennessee Legislature to-day be
          confirmed, was promised by Secretary
          Colby when word of the vote at Nash?
          ville reached the State Department. He
          was prepared, Mr. Colby said, to issue
          the necessary proclamation immediate?
          ly on receipt of official notice that
          Tennessee had ratified the amendment.
          j When the word of ratification came
          officials of the National Woman's party
          at once sought assurances from Secre?
          tary Colby that the official action pro- j
          mulgating the amendment would not I
          be delayed. They also urged their rep?
          resentatives in Nashville to see that no
          time was lost in forwarding the official
          notice to the State Department.
          The woman's party also announced
          that steps toward a national celebra-1
          tion at the cankar liad been taken. The'
          date will be fixed later, and included in
          the ceremonies will be the presentation
          to the national Capitol of marble busts'
          of the rtio of suffrage pioneers Susan j
          B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton
          and Lucretia Mott -which it is hop'-d i
          will be placed either in the Hall of
          Fame or the rotunda of the great
          building. The statue of Frances Wil
          lard, presented by Illinois, is the only;
          woman's figure now in the Hall of
          Fame.
          There still is suffrage work to be
          done, the National American Woman
          I Suffrage Association emphasized in a
          I statement issued from the headquar- I
          i ters here yesterday. The association
          j takes it for granted that opposition to
          the Susan B. Anthonv amendment will i
          continue to develop and will show itself
          in court action to prevent the amend- i
          ment becoming operative.
          The association declares it is pre-j
          paring to meet any attacks which may
          be made in this direction. "It expects
          the Secretary of State to proclaim the
          amendment at once as ratified," the'
          statement says. "This would seem to
          be automatically inevitable. Even if
          the amendment is to be the subject of
          later attack, the Secretary of State's
          immediate task is the proclamation.1
          Without the proclamation there is no
          amendment to attack."
          The word "male" will not have to bei
          stricken from state constitutions, be?
          cause it is "read out by the amendment
          itself," the statement asserts. The
          opinion of Charles E. Hughes is quoted
          in support, of this contention.
          "Can the Presidential election be
          thrown out if women participate in it?"
          the statement asks. Its answer is:
          "Opponents could no more throw out
          the Presidential election or find any;
          grounds upon which to raise such a
          hope than they could cause the sun, to
          stsnd still." But the suffragists, the
          statement says, wi?'?M have ground to!
          throw out an election if women were
          denied the rigrit to participate.
          "Suffragists long ago ceas?jd to je
          frightened at anti-suffrage threats,"
          the statement say-, "none of which was
          ever quite so fatuous as this one."

          when they were told that the amend.

          naa been expecting a public ceremony
          however, and seemed to be quite dis
          appointed when they learned that
          there would be none. Theyasked
          for a repeating of the ceremony in or
          der that moving pictures could be tak.

          part in the ceremony. Colby replied
          that he would consider the matter and
          reUred to his private office. The suf

          won.
          Colby later announced that the rea
          son why there was no public cere
          mony was because he was not sure
          which group of leaders should take

          W. J. Cormack in News and Courier.
          Columbia, Sept. .4.?Because of
          the passage of the 19th amendment
          the availability of women as school
          and college trustees was indorsed by
          the state board of education, which
          ended a two day session -here this
          afternoon.
          The board's session was replete
          with much business of an important!
          character/ particularly the approval
          of the scholarships for Winthrop and
          Clemson colleges and the University1
          of South Carolina, already an- j
          nounced. The Citadel list will be;
          given to the press in the next few
          days. Various contents were heard!
          and resignations of county superintendents
          of education accepted.
          The board said that because of the
          tremendous influx of children into i
          the schools and the need of additional
          facilities the appropriation by!
          the legislature for the public school
          system next year will have to be at j
          least $2,000,000. It was pointed out
          that the phenomenal growth .of local
          taxation for school purposes shows
          that the people approve of better j
          school facilities. The board recommended
          larger salaries for teachers j
          and county superintendents of education.

          last Tuesday's election can not accent
          at this time because of business j
          reasons.
          Examinations for teaching will be
          held in every county court house October
          1, by county superintendents,
          and there will be extra examinations
          whenever necessary.

          and dismissed, the decisions of coun- j
          ty board boards of educations being
          sustained.
          The advisability of a thorough survey
          covering primary, grammar and
          high schools and collegiate education
          was indorsed by the board, which deplored
          the hardships under gone by
          state colleges in getting eligible applicants
          for scholarships from the various
          counties, causing many vacancies.
          "FX'istincr school laws and existing
          needs of the schools," said Mr.
          Swearingen in discussing the financial
          situation, "will require public
          school appropriation of at least $2,000,000
          by the next legislature. The
          compulsory attendance act has improved
          the enrolment and attendance
          of the schools in a marked degree.
          High school diplomas hereafter will
          be awarded to pupils completing 15
          units." The phenominal growth of
          local taxation was pointed out as a
          sure sign of universal popular inter
          est in education. The improvement
          in teachers' salaries was heartily
          commended. The necessity of higher
          qualifications and better salaries in
          the office of county superintendent
          was strongly empasized.

          POINT AT ISSUE
          AS TO TENNESSEE
          GENERAL MISAPPREHENSION AS
          TO REAL QUESTION
          Ratification
          Seems Secure, But States
          Should Segregate Women's
          Ballots.

          Washington, Sept. 4.?Widespread
          misapprehension exists as to the real
          point at issue in the discussion as
          to whether or not Tennessee has really
          ratified the 19th amendment to
          the constitution of the United States,
          thus giving the privilege of suffrage
          to women on an equal basis with men
          in all the states.
          The question at issue now is not
          whether or not a state can withdraw
          ratification once made. Pages of
          printed comment have been devoted
          to the action of New York in such a
          matter years ago. As there is a heavy
          prosuffrage majority in the Tennessee
          senate, no possibility of the legislature's
          reversing its former action
          appears to exist.
          It is the contention of the anti--suffragists
          that Tennessee never did
          ratify the 19th amendment and that
          the proclamation by Secretary of
          State Colby was erroneous. This con-1

          tary argument that a motion to reconsider
          the vote by which the lower
          house of the Tennessee legislature j
          approved the amendment was pending
          and not disposed of when the
          governor certified to Washington that
          the ratification had been accomplish-;
          ed. It is further argued that a reso-'
          lution can not be adopted while a j
          motion to reconsider it is pending.
          i
          True it is that in accepted parliamentary
          procedure a bill is not regarded
          as passed if a motion to reconsider
          it is pending. This rule has
          the authority of congress and has
          been invoked frequently by the speakers
          of the house of representat ves.
          If this rule settled the case it
          would seem clear that Tennessee
          never did ratify the 19th amendment
          and that the proclamation made
          by Secretary Colfcy was erroreous.
          Whether or not that proclamation
          could be annulled and_ the error cor
          r^cted would then become a nice
          question of law.
          Cut there is another ruling, which
          prevails in congress, and has the ap-'
          proval of the United States supremo
          court, and this rulir.g may dccide the
          validity of the 19th amendment. The
          current manual of the house of representatives
          contains this note under
          the sections relating to reconsiaeration

          signed by the speaker and approved,
          by the president, it is undobtedly a
          law, although a motion to reconsider
          may'not have been disposed of."
          The foregoing note has the support
          of a footnote in Hinds' precedents,
          the standard congressional parliamentary
          authority, which says:
          "The courts have commented, 011
          this subject: 'The effect of the
          pendency of a motiop to reconsider,
          according to universal usage, is to

          the motion to reconsider and before
          that motion has been acted upon been
          presented to the president and received
          his approval, the validity of
          the act, it would seem, could not
          be questioned on account of the
          pendency of such motion, the signI
          ing of the bill by the speaker and
          vice president being complete and
          unimpeachable evidence of its passage.
          (See Field vs. Clark, 143 U.
          S. supreme court reports, p. G50, Feb.
          29, 1892.)'
          The regularity of the signatures
          by the legislature's officials in Tennessee
          may be assumed and it would
          appear quite probable that the quoted j
          ruling of the supreme court puts the
          Tennessee ratification beyond successful
          attack.
          Nevertheless, as a practical mat- j
          ter, the subject is one of dispute, and
          there is probability of prolonged liti- j
          nation upon it, and prudent politicians
          believe that every precaution
          should be taken to avert confusion
          over the results of November's elecI
          tion. Tiie case can hardly reach the
          supreme court for final ratification

          While the race issue looms very
          ominously on the horizon, it is not
          the paramount issue. The issue
          above all others is the danger of I

          whk-h belong to the states into
          ihe control of the Federal Gov-'iana
          ernment.

          and continue to grow where they
          are self-governing.
          By the ratification of the 19th
          Amendment the Federal Govern
          ment will secure control in all elec
          tions. national, state, municipal,

          vote is approximately 66 per cent
          of the entire voting strength of
          the country. The w r hite men alone
          will 'be free in state and municipal
          elections, but as they only repre
          sent 40 per cent of the voting
          strength it would not be a very
          difficult task for the Federal Gov
          ernment to bring them under its
          I autocratic sway.
          The cry sent out from the Na
          tional Democratic Party to Louis
          Gov-'iana to be the 26th state to ratify
          'and thus gain the gratitude of the
          rest of the country is so weak that
          it would be pathetic if it was not
          so dangerous, for it is tempting
          men to throw aside their princi
          pies and cover themselves with the
          cloak of expediency. God forbid
          j that the South should ever stoop
          low as to curry favor with the
          northern and western democrats
          by putting her head in this noose
          bv which they are trying to stran
          hef future.
          j Besides the statement that the
          amendment has secured all but
          the one vote necessary to ratify
          is not true. Ohio cannot be coun
          ted among the states which have
          ratified until the Supreme Court
          of the United States decides her
          case which is still pending.
          Neither is it true that if Louisi
          ana does not ratify and thus lose
          that imaginary gratitude which
          we are told the northern and
          western democrats are yearning to
          bestow upon us, that North Car
          olina will ratify and thus com
          plete the 6 states. They sent out
          this wolf cry about »Delaware but
          Delaware still stays out of the
          fold, faithful to the unwritten
          law if southern solidarity by

          N person to person calls the person originating the call specifies a
          particular person to be reached. When a person to person call
          is made, the company not only must do everything that it does
          in a station to station call to establish a communication, but must do
          it at a time whep the particular person called will be available, and
          will, as a matter of fact, talk. Obviously, the company has no control
          over the whereabouts of persons called, and there is involved an additional
          expense and circuit use, and uncertainty, caused by conditions over which
          the company has no control or influence. So that it is both logical and proper
          that the charge for a person to person call should be relatively more than
          the station to station call.
          Orders for person to person calls are accepted only under the condition
          that a limited charge will be made when under certain conditions, it is im
          possible to establish communication between specified persons. This charge
          is classified as a "report charge."

          And to whom does Louisiana
          owe strongest allegiance I want
          to ask the men of'Louisiana—the
          northern and western democrats
          who do not give a snap of their
          finger for the Soutl\. or to our sis
          ter states w T ho have stoocf with an
          by Louisiana in the dreadful years
          of reconstruction? Are Louisi
          ana men going to put South and
          North Carolina, Georgia, Ala
          bama, and Mississippi under ne
          gro domination, for remember
          well, if Louisiana helps to ratify
          the 19tji Amendment she condones
          the 15th amendment and cannot
          interefere when Congress insists,
          as it should and undoubtedly will,
          upon the enforcement of the 19th
          Amendment.
          Another suggestion. Does not
          a cause take on a sinister aspect
          when only eighteen months ago the
          representatives of the organiza
          tion of the Democratic Party in
          the city of New Orleans ordered
          suffrage by state enactment to 'be
          killed and it was killed, but these
          same men today are shouting from
          the house-tops for justice to wo
          men. but said justice to be se
          cured only through one method'—
          the 19th amendment. Show your
          sponsors and one can read pretty
          clear the spirit behind the meas
          ure.
          The reason for this whole
          change of front on the part of the
          leaders of the Democratic Party
          is because of the pressure being
          brought to bear bv the negro vot
          ers in the North and West, who"
          are insisting upon the enforce
          ment of the 14th and loth amend
          ment in the South. 1 do not ask
          you to take my word for this
          statement—read such admirably
          edited neero papers as The Crisis,
          the Chicago Defender, the New
          York Age and others of a like
          character.
          Now to show the fallacy of the
          statement urged by the support
          ers of the 19th Amendment. All
          the eminent opinions cited in the
          Item harp on the fact that becanse
          the vote of the colored woman
          will he protested under the same
          provision which protect the col
          ored man. the lr»th amendment,
          it does not matter whether the
          ballot be ^ranted to women by the
          state or federal route. Bnt it
          does matter very seriously if we
          are interested in preserving any
          vestige of state control. Let me
          try to make this just as clear as
          possible. Under present condi
          tions the Federal Government
          cannot supervise or control the
          vote of white men in state elec
          tions. The Federal Government
          does control the vote of colored
          men, also the vote of colored wo
          men no mattejj which way the bal
          lot is conferred, but the Federal
          Government will not have control
          of the vote of the white women
          if the ballot, if given by state en
          actment. Ttyis leaves the white
          men and the white women under
          state control. This is certainly
          sufficient reason to refuse to rati
          fy the Federal Amendment which
          throws the white women, the col
          ored women and the colored men
          all together under Federal con
          trol.
          I ask that the men and women
          of this state ponder well when
          they endorse either by acceptance
          or failure to protest this 19th
          amendment what they are putting
          over in this country. This is 110
          time to refuse to express an opin
          ion—the responsibility of silence
          is to© heavy.

          Democrats Make Suffrage
          San Francisco, June 25.-The
          Democratic: national committee today
          unanimously agreed to send a tele
          gram to the governor of Tennessee
          urging a special session of the legis
          lature to ratify the federal suffrage
          amendment.
          The committee met late today to
          make up the temporary roll of dele
          gates, to consider contests and to dis
          pose of other business preliminary to
          the opening of the convention next
          Monday. H. S. Cummings, chairman.
          Probably the largest number of wo
          men that ever attended a meeting of
          the committee was present. Ar^ong
          the arrivals was Senator James S.
          Reed, who claimed a seat in the con
          vention as a delegate for the Fifth
          Missouri district. Representatives of
          the two large groups of delegates con
          testing for Georgia's 28 seats were
          also on hand.
          There was vigorous applause when
          Chairman Cummings suggested the
          sending of a telegram to Governor
          Roberts of Tennessee, urging him to
          call a special session of the legisla
          ture to ratify the federal suffrage
          amendment.
          Without Opposing Vote.
          The suggestion was unanimous
          ly adopted.
          Following is the telegram sent to
          the governor of Tennessee:
          "The Democratic national com
          mittee at its meeting held today by
          unanimous vote directed me, as chair
          man of the committee to send you
          the following message:
          1 "We most earnestly emphasize the
          extreme importance and urgency of
          an immediate meeting1 of your state
          legislature for the purpose of ratify
          ing the proposed 19th amendment
          to the federal constitution. The eyes
          of the millions of women throughout
          the country are turned toward Ten
          nessee as the one state that can and
          will enfranchise them- prior to the
          November election by becoming the
          36th state to ratify the suffrage
          amendment.
          'We ?rust that for the present all
          other legislative matters may, if nec
          essary, be held in abeyance and that
          you will call an extra session of the
          legislature of your state for such
          brief duration as may be required to'
          act favorably on the amendment'.
          Tennessee occupies a position of pe
          culiar and pivotal importance and
          one that enables her to render a ser
          vice, of incalcuiabla value to the wo
          men of America. We confidently ex
          pect, therefore under your leadership
          and through your action of the leg
          islature of your state the women of
          the nation may be given the privilege
          of voting in the coming presidential
          election.'
          Homer S. Cummings, Chairman
          National Committee."
          Nashville, Tenn., June 25.-Gov.
          A. H. Roberts, on reaching Jackson,
          Tenn., where he speaks this after
          noon, sent a telegram to President
          Wilson, stating that he intended to
          include ratification of the 19th
          amendment inhis call for an extra
          session of the legislature, provided
          the state of legal department advised
          him that ratification could now be
          made.
          When the govenor's telegram was
          sent he had not heard that Attorney
          General Thompson had sent him an
          opinion here advising that the pres
          ent legislature could ratify the
          amendment.
          Raleigh, N. C., June 25.-Declar
          ing that President Wilson's telegram
          calling attention to the importance
          of the North Carolina action en the
          federal suffrage amendment requir
          ed no answer, Governor Bickett to
          day stated that he had nothing to add
          to the statement he has already made
          relative to his views toward suffrage.
          Those views were expressed in a
          letter to W. N. Everett of Rocking
          ham, N. C., suffrage leader in the
          1919 legislature, who asked the gov
          ernor to champion the cause of wo
          men in the state convention. The
          governor in this letter, made public
          March 15, declined to do this, but he
          added
          "Some time ago I decided to ad
          vise the general assembly at the spe
          cial session in July to ratify the fed
          eral amendment. It is the sensible
          and the graceful thing to do. It fol
          lows that I am in favor of the Demo
          cratic convention indorsing the
          amendment when it meets in April.*
          Voicing his own personal fears in
          regard to suffrage, Governor Bickett
          added in that letter:
          "But my dear Mr. Everett my
          fears do not blind my eyes and I
          clearly see that today a condition
          and not a theory confronts the Demo
          cratic party in North Carolina. Wo
          man suffrage is coming. It is as ir
          resistible as the tides, and I am con
          vinced it is the part of wisdom for
          the Democratic party in North Caro
          lina to accept it gracefully."

          the leglalature ratified the amend

          Legislatures Violate Oath of Office
          "Thirty-eight atate ratified the 19th
          amendment, the legislatures in 80
          cases having been elected before the
          subject was submitted for their con

          ioin Politics was hot in those days.
          Thirty-five states had already ratified
          the 19th amendment. One. more was
          needed. The governor reminded the
          legislature that it could not take ac
          tion. It made no airrerence. ,rjr
          state constitution, a quorum in the
          ower house is two-thirds or us ioiai
          membership. There were in
          i A a ntinrnm would be 66. In
          order to block action on the amend
          ment, the minority moved out of the
          state and when the legislature opened
          its session there were only 59 present
          in the house. It made no om.
          The amendment was ratified by a vote
          of 60 to 9.
          "The legislators ignored their own
          constitution twice, by voting on an
          amendment when they were not qual
          ified to do so and by ratifying it with
          less than a quorum present.
          "The news was sent to Washington
          that the Tennessee legislature had
          ratified the amendment and the eec
          retary of state proclaimed that the
          '19 th amendment had been adopted.
          Then the Tennessee legislature recon
          vened and passed a resolution rescind
          ing its former action. The news was
          smt to Washington, but the secretary
          of state said the people in Tennessee
          were too late, the amendment had
          been adopted.
          "Things of that sort, it repeated on
          a large scale, present many harmful
          possibilities."
          Propaganda.
          Senator Wadsworth dwelt to acme
          extent on propaganda, saying that
          this form of influencing opinion has
          not reached Its full strength by one
          third. "Men become professionals at It,"
          he said. "They are well supplied with
          funds, become akillful politically and
          then learn how to influence legislative
          bodies and convince them that the
          people are overwhelmingly. In favor
          of their projects.
          "In one day 1 received 410 tele
          grams on a single proposal. The first
          might, have made an impression on
          me If the 409 otnera naa not Been
          couched In identical language.
          "Some propaganda is. good end
          some propagandists are sincere," Sen
          ator Wadsworth said, "but some is
          being conducted to undermine the
          government. The propagandist who Is
          trying to do this works 866 days in
          the year. He works from within to
          substitute a socialistic etats for our
          preaent form of government. He
          hopes and believes that he can get
          his Ideas Into the constitution while
          the people are not looking. He can
          point to the .past for examples and
          hope tney can be repeated."
          Voice of the People,
          Returning to hia original theme.
          Senator Wadsworth said: "People
          who can create and set up a govern
          ment should have the right to direct
          ly pas upon any proposed changes In
          that government. That is funda
          mental. "If we are to safeguard our ron-
          stitution we should See that our chil
          dren and our grandchildren learn Its
          meaning. The constitution Is the po
          litical expression of the Golden Rule.
          There are some deluded people whoi
          care not for Its basic principles, who
          would wear down and destroy It Just!
          like drops of water will eventually
          wear away a atone
          "Let the people have the right fo
          pas upon amendments to the consti
          tution, which right most of us
          thought the p-ople had prior to th
          decision In the case of Ohio."

          Signers of Petition for Wo
          man's Suffrage in the Town
          of Edgefield.
          (Continued from page Five.)
          from a woman's hea^ and trained in
          every principle 02 religion that
          could keep them strong, and yet they
          have found something on the street
          to defile-then in the strength of her
          love she has said "There is another
          place bf activity for me besides that
          in the home. For the sake of this
          spot we call home and the happiness
          that should reign there, I must be up
          and in the great world to do my
          part."
          From this condition has arisen all
          the great Women's organizations of
          the world, which have been protests
          .against some enemy of the home or a
          challenge to some great refoim. Wo
          men have been resourceful through
          out all the ages. What they could not
          get by one means, they would at
          tempt by another.
          Perhaps the Woman's Christian
          .Temperance Union was the earliest
          protest against the invasion by the li
          quor traffic of the homes of our na
          tion. Without the ballot for many,
          they worked unrelentingly for the
          overthrow of this tyrant which slew)
          their best beloved. From the ranks of
          this organization many women came
          to realize that it would in the last
          analysis be the ballot in the hands of
          wou.en which would cause King Al
          cohol's final overthrow, and they be
          gan to put themselves into the ?fight
          for suffrage. Among these were Dr.
          Anna Howard Shaw and Mr:;. Carrie
          ?Chapman Catt. This was largely true,
          because the women suffrage states
          were large instrumental in bringing
          about the ratification of the 18th
          Amendment. This wonderful fact
          has been credited, to a large extent,
          to the ballot in the hands of women.
          Norway, as soon as the ballot was
          given to women, became a prohibi
          tion country. Scotland is now in a!
          campaign, and the leaders say there I
          will be no trouble, as the Scottish'
          women have the ballot.
          The Federation of Women's Clubs,
          organized primarily for culture and
          study, is studying Home Economics
          as well, making a specialty of Child
          Welfare and public health; the Pa
          1 rent- Teachers Associations every
          where for closer connection between
          the parents and teachers is most
          largely a woman's organization; the j
          great Council of Women, the Moth-
          ers' Congress, all these organizations
          are movements for the betterment j
          and happiness of the home life. The
          Daughters of the American Revolu
          tion and the Daughters of the Con
          federacy stand for the protection of
          the American home, the kindling of
          patiotic fires, the Americanizing of j
          .all who come to our shores; the Red'
          Cross, the Travellers' Aid, all these!
          are exponents of womens' ideals, and
          are already being incorporated into
          government. Most of the laws on our
          statuce books, like the police women
          for the protection of women in large j
          cities, motion picture laws, women j
          in industry, child welfare, the anti-1
          cigarette laws, the teaching of the
          effects of narcotics and liquors on I
          the human system in our public
          schools the anti-canteen laws for
          the protection of our army and navy,
          and those laws which protect the
          morals of our soldiers and sailors
          have come from the mother heart of t
          our nation expressed through peti-j!
          tions and resolutions and pressure
          upon our law makers for the passage j
          of such laws.
          These same laws which have come
          by the Ideals of women and their.!
          spiritual vision, will never be proper
          ly enforced until those who inspired
          them have a voice and vote in their
          enforcement.
          All these things and many more,
          they have done without the ballot.
          What will they do when they have
          that added advantage!
          It is now the concensus of opinion
          that it will be but a few more months
          before the 19th Amendment will be
          ratified by the 36 necessary states.
          According to statements of leaders,
          after a careful census has been taken
          ?of the various legislatures, it has
          .been announced that 32 states are
          :safe, for the amendment. Out of the
          14 remaining states which are doubt
          ful, the women expect to secure four
          or more which will be necessary for
          ratification. The 19th Amendment
          may have been ratified by the August
          elections, and the South Carolina wo
          men are asking the General Assem
          bly to ratify it, that when they are
          enfranchised they may exercise that
          privilege by the consent of their own
          General Assembly and not over their
          protest.
          We were all very much interested
          in the suffrage campaign in England
          before the war, when the women de
          manded the ballot, and were turned
          down with great rigor being jailed
          and forcibly^ fed. This movement in
          Fngland was led by the upper classes j
